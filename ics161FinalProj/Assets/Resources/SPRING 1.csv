,,,
M,I let out a relieved sigh and stretch out in relief on my desk.,none,main
,,,
M,I just completed my first day of high school.,none,main
,,,
M,Besides the fact it’s been almost a year since I’ve been through a proper school day,none,main
,,,
M,Everyone was excited to see a new transfer studentXYZ especially a senior.,none,main
,,,
M,I’ve spent so much time in the city that I forgot how easily things can become news in a small town.,none,main
,,,
MC,Where to now…,none,main
,,,
M,Even if I won’t be here longXYZ it won’t do me any good if I’m getting lost all semester.,none,main
,,,
M,I proceed to explore the schoolXYZ taking mental note of each turn…,none,main
,,,
M,erXYZ or so I thought. I forgot how many turns I made and now,none,main
,,,
M,I don’t even know which way to start backtracking. Shoot!,none,main
,,,
MC,Why does every classroom look the same?? Am I even in the same building…,none,main
,,,
Haruka,AhXYZ sorry to botherXYZ but do you think you might be lost?,default,main
,,,
M,I hear a small yet familiar sounding voice from behind me.,default,main
,,,
M,D-Did I just say what I said before out loud?? Oh crap...,default,main
,,,
MC,UhhhXYZ yesXYZ yes I am. I just transferred hereXYZ so...,default,main
,,,
M,SmallTalk.exe not found.,default,main
,,,
M,I turn around and see a small-framed girl with blush colored hair and bright green eyes.,default,main
,,,
M,OhXYZ I thought she looked familiar… it’s the cherry blossom girl I had a strange conversation with earlier.,default,main
,,,
Haruka,Oh!,default,main
,,,
M,Before I could confirm my assumptionsXYZ Haruka’s face beamed with the same sudden realization.,default,main
,,,
Haruka,I saw you while walking to schoolXYZ didn’t I? Sorry for not introducing myself earlier,default,main
,,,
Haruka,My name is Haruka YamauchiXYZ you introduced yourself to my class today.,default,main
,,,
MC,AhXYZ nice to properly meet you.,default,main
,,,
Haruka,You just moved hereXYZ right? This school can be pretty confusing. If I’m not paying attention I could easily walk pass our classroom tooXYZ hehe.,default,main
,,,
M,Our classroom…? I look to my rightXYZ and sure enoughXYZ there’s a familiar sign clearly labelled with my classroom number.,default,main
,,,
M,Shit.,default,main
,,,
MC,O-Oh... I really was lost. Thank youXYZ I would’ve been in circles for hours.,default,main
,,,
M,I could feel my face glow with embarrassmentXYZ and Haruka starts to giggleXYZ slightly.,default,main
,,,
Haruka,Hehe. You’re not wrong thoughXYZ this school is pretty modernXYZ so many of the hallways look similar.,default,main
,,,
MC,That’s for sure.,default,main
,,,
M,Hmm... I hate to ask a strangerXYZ but at this rateXYZ I’ll be walking in circles the rest of my high school life.,default,main
,,,
MC,HarukaXYZ I don’t really know anyone else at this schoolXYZ so… if you’re not busyXYZ do you think you could show me around?,default,main
,,,
Haruka,Hm?,default,main
,,,
M,I felt a second wave of embarrassment take over. Our conversation earlier wasn’t the most… conventional. I’m not so sure someone like Haruka would want to show a gloomy guy around.,default,main
,,,
M,Before I could turn any redderXYZ Haruka smiles shyly.,default,main
,,,
Haruka,Sure! If you don’t mind me. I can show you around right nowXYZ if you’d like.,default,main
,,,
MC,I would appreciate that. Thank you.,default,main
,,,
Haruka,Great! I’ll show you the library firstXYZ its my favorite place…,default,main
,,,
M,She shows me around the libraryXYZ fieldXYZ and other school facilities.,default,main
,,,
M,We naturally make small talk.,default,main
,,,
M,Despite our cherry blossom dialogue earlierXYZ I learn she’s pretty serious about her studies. She likes to have her quiet time in the library and read when she feels like being alone.,default,main
,,,
M,I was surprised to hear thatXYZ since she has such a cheerful and bright aura… she probably gets along well with anyone.,default,main
,,,
M,She seemed like the kind of person who was always surrounded by others.,default,main
,,,
Haruka,AaandXYZ were back to the classroom. I tried to cover all the important places…,default,main
,,,
MC,Already? Time flew... I really owe you one.,default,main
,,,
M,The copper sunset shone through the hall windows. A lot of time really had passed…,default,main
,,,
M,It was going to get dark soon.,default,main
,,,
M,Haruka notices me staring out the windowXYZ and looks at the dim sky as well.,default,main
,,,
Haruka,Ah! It’s already getting darkXYZ I should get going…,default,main
,,,
M,Oh no… I kept her here this longXYZ I feel bad. Should I offer to walk her home?,default,main
,,,
M,Maybe that’s too bold to ask right now… but…,default,main
,,,
M,The right thing to do is offer to walk her home. PlusXYZ maybe I’ll get to know her a bit better.,default,main
,,,
MC,HarukaXYZ it’s my fault for keeping you out this late. Is it okay I walk you home?,default,main
,,,
Haruka,Oh! D-Don’t worry… you don’t have to…,default,main
,,,
MC,I knowXYZ but it’s the least I can do. Is it okayXYZ then?,default,main
,,,
Haruka,Ah sure… thank you...,default,main
,,,
M,We grab our things and make our way out the school.,default,main
,,,
M,My thoughts begin to wander.,default,main
,,,
M,We just met but… she seems awfully generous to show a stranger around.,default,main
,,,
M,And then that conversation near the blossoms as well… it seems a bit odd…,default,main
,,,
M,Unlike beforeXYZ Haruka was strangely quiet.,default,main
,,,
M,And why didn’t she notice who I was earlier…? Is it really just a coincidence?,default,main
,,,
M,I think hard. I want to ask her straight outXYZ but I don’t want to come off accusatory. I need evidence.,default,main
,,,
M,I don’t know how to approach thisXYZ I just met her after all…,default,main
,,,
M,Just think… what can I say to figure this out…?,default,main
