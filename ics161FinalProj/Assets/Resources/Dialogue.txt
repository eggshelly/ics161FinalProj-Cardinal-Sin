INTRODUCTION
M: 10 years ago
M: I walked this same path
M: to reach the other side of a town that, at the time
M: I would call home.
M: The new buildings and paved walkways made the little rural town I grew up in almost unrecognizable, but 
M: Something about being back here, for the first time… since I lost someone...
M: made everything feel more familiar. 
M: This time last Spring, my Mother, after a long battle
M: succumbed to her illness and passed on. 
M: I spent the last four seasons grieving, letting time pass by…
M: Wishing things were different...
M: Until I realized, even if time seemed to stop in my cramped room
M: Seasons were still changing outside. And I was missing all of it. 
M: As last winter’s snow began to melt, signaling the coming of a new school term
M: my remaining family gently suggested to finish my last year as a high school student in a more familiar setting.
M: My hometown.
M: In the distance, I see trees dotted with flush colored blossoms, slowly growing near.
MC: Cherry blossoms. Those were her favorite.
M: I stop in the middle of the road, basking in the comfortable Spring breeze, recalling the times my mom would drag me to the cherry blossom viewings.
M: We’ve been to many different ones, but…
M: Nothing could ever compare to my home town’s blossoms. 
Haruka: They’re pretty, aren’t they?
MC: Huh? 
M: I turn to see a small girl with blush colored hair, gazing at the same tree I was dazed by. 
MC: Yeah... too bad they don’t last very long, though. 
Haruka: Hm…
M: The girl shakes her head, still admiring the budding flowers. 
Haruka: Isn’t that part of their beauty, though?
Haruka: The fact you know they won’t be there long, but…
Haruka: you spend extra time looking at them anyways?
MC: …
Haruka: In the countryside, there are so many wonderful plants and flowers that bloom year-round.
Haruka: But people always make a big event of seeing the ones that don’t last long. It must be because they’re temporary, don’t you think?
M: Temporary…
M: So many unhappy memories attached to a single word.
M: If there’s anything I’ve learned this past year…
M: ...is that the only permanent thing in life is the passage of time.
M: And time takes away things.
MC: I guess that means we just take things for granted, then.
M: The girl laughs a bit.
Haruka: That’s a bit dark!
M: She turns to me, the slight breeze catching her hair.
Haruka: I’d like to think…
Haruka: We just know how to especially appreciate things enough, before they go.
M: Before they go…
M: 10 years ago, I walked this same path.
M: This time, I’m walking on a branching path that wasn’t paved before,
M: to the other side of a town that
M: Is no longer my home.
SPRING 1
MC: Ah… so tiring!
M: I let out a relieved sigh and stretch out in relief on my desk. 
M: I just completed my first day of high school.
M: Besides the fact it’s been almost a year since I’ve been through a proper school day
M: Everyone was excited to see a new transfer student, especially a senior. 
M: I’ve spent so much time in the city that I forgot how easily things can become news in a small town.
MC: Where to now…
M: Even if I won’t be here long, it won’t do me any good if I’m getting lost all semester. 
M: I proceed to explore the school, taking mental note of each turn…
M: er, or so I thought. I forgot how many turns I made and now
M: I don’t even know which way to start backtracking. Shoot!
MC: Why does every classroom look the same?? Am I even in the same building… 
Haruka: Ah, sorry to bother, but do you think you might be lost? 
M: I hear a small yet familiar sounding voice from behind me. 
M: D-Did I just say what I said before out loud?? Oh crap...
MC: Uhhh, yes, yes I am. I just transferred here, so... 
M: SmallTalk.exe not found. 
M: I turn around and see a small-framed girl with blush colored hair and bright green eyes. 
M: Oh, I thought she looked familiar… it’s the cherry blossom girl I had a strange conversation with earlier.
Haruka: Oh!
M: Before I could confirm my assumptions, Haruka’s face beamed with the same sudden realization.
Haruka: I saw you while walking to school, didn’t I? Sorry for not introducing myself earlier
Haruka: My name is Haruka Yamauchi, you introduced yourself to my class today.
MC: Ah, nice to properly meet you.
Haruka: You just moved here, right? This school can be pretty confusing. If I’m not paying attention I could easily walk pass our classroom too, hehe.
M: Our classroom…? I look to my right, and sure enough, there’s a familiar sign clearly labelled with my classroom number.
M: Shit.
MC: O-Oh... I really was lost. Thank you, I would’ve been in circles for hours. 
M: I could feel my face glow with embarrassment, and Haruka starts to giggle, slightly. 
Haruka: Hehe. You’re not wrong though, this school is pretty modern, so many of the hallways look similar.
MC: That’s for sure.
M: Hmm... I hate to ask a stranger, but at this rate, I’ll be walking in circles the rest of my high school life.
MC: Haruka, I don’t really know anyone else at this school, so… if you’re not busy, do you think you could show me around?
Haruka: Hm? 
M: I felt a second wave of embarrassment take over. Our conversation earlier wasn’t the most… conventional. I’m not so sure someone like Haruka would want to show a gloomy guy around.
M: Before I could turn any redder, Haruka smiles shyly.
Haruka: Sure! If you don’t mind me. I can show you around right now, if you’d like. 
MC: I would appreciate that. Thank you.
Haruka: Great! I’ll show you the library first, its my favorite place… 
M: She shows me around the library, field, and other school facilities.
M: We naturally make small talk.
M: Despite our cherry blossom dialogue earlier, I learn she’s pretty serious about her studies. She likes to have her quiet time in the library and read when she feels like being alone. 
M: I was surprised to hear that, since she has such a cheerful and bright aura… she probably gets along well with anyone.
M: She seemed like the kind of person who was always surrounded by others.
Haruka: Aaand, were back to the classroom. I tried to cover all the important places… 
MC: Already? Time flew... I really owe you one.
M: The copper sunset shone through the hall windows. A lot of time really had passed… 
M: It was going to get dark soon. 
M: Haruka notices me staring out the window, and looks at the dim sky as well. 
Haruka: Ah! It’s already getting dark, I should get going… 
M: Oh no… I kept her here this long, I feel bad. Should I offer to walk her home? 
M: Maybe that’s too bold to ask right now… but… 
M: The right thing to do is offer to walk her home. Plus, maybe I’ll get to know her a bit better.
MC: Haruka, it’s my fault for keeping you out this late. Is it okay I walk you home?
Haruka: Oh! D-Don’t worry… you don’t have to… 
MC: I know, but it’s the least I can do. Is it okay, then?
Haruka: Ah sure… thank you... 
M: We grab our things and make our way out the school.
M: My thoughts begin to wander. 
M: We just met but… she seems awfully generous to show a stranger around.
M: And then that conversation near the blossoms as well… it seems a bit odd…
M: Unlike before, Haruka was strangely quiet.
M: And why didn’t she notice who I was earlier…? Is it really just a coincidence?
M: I think hard. I want to ask her straight out, but I don’t want to come off accusatory. I need evidence.
M: I don’t know how to approach this, I just met her after all… 
M: Just think… what can I say to figure this out…? 
SPRING 1 GOOD END
M: The answer hits me like cold water to the face. That’s right!
M: How could she not recognize me earlier, if she noticed that I was lost? That seems highly unlikely. I’ll ask her about that. 
M: Before I could say anything, Haruka stops in front of a small apartment complex.
Haruka: Well, this is where I live. Thank you for walking me all this way. 
MC: …
M: I let my voice break the awkward silence.
MC: Haruka, before you go… can I ask you something?
Haruka: Hm? 
MC: Earlier, when I was lost, you acted like you didn’t recognize me, but… 
MC: You knew who I was, right? Since you said you saw me pass the classroom. 
M: Haruka’s surprised look slowly melts into a shy smile.
Haruka: Mm… you caught me, haha. I...
Haruka: ...I actually knew you were the transfer student all along. Even when we were at the trees. In a small town, there’s no way I wouldn’t recognize you unless you were a new student.
Haruka: And then today... I saw you pass by our class a few times and I could tell you were lost. So I thought it was a perfect opportunity to talk to you.
MC: Talk to me? Why me? 
Haruka: Because I wanted to be the one to help you, since...
Haruka: I actually only transferred here a year ago, last Spring. Due to unfortunate circumstances, I had to leave my high school midway and start a new life here.
Haruka: So I know what it feels like to feel overwhelmed, and it can get pretty lonely if you have no one to talk to, so… 
Haruka: … let’s get along, okay? 
M: Her voice trails off at the end, that I could barely catch the last part. 
M: I let out a relieving laugh and feel my nerves subside. For the first time in a while, I felt like I had made a friend. A friend I could relate to.    
MC: Yes, I’d like that. Don’t be afraid to be forward with me, okay?
MC: I’ll see you tomorrow, Haruka. 
M: I wave, and start walking away. But out of the corner of my eye
M: I realize Haruka was the same shade of red I was when we first met. 
SPRING 1 BAD END
M: ...I analyzed the situation, over and over, but…
M: I just couldn’t figure out how to approach the subject. Maybe it’s just a coincidence after all. 
M: Before I could think of anything to say, Haruka stops in front of a small apartment complex.
Haruka: Well, this is where I live. Thank you for walking me all this way.
MC: No problem. Well, see you tomorrow
Haruka: See… you...
M: As I make my way down the street, I can’t help but feel as if there was a slight sound of disappointment in her words.
M: And the fact she seemed to not recognize me earlier still seems… far fetched…
M: I do my best to shake it off. It’s probably all just in my head, right? 
M: At least, I’ve met someone new at this school.
