SUMMER 4
M: Summer vacation flew by even quicker than usual. I spent most of it at Natsuki’s, watching her complain while she did her summer school work. The occasional times we went out, we somehow ended up at the same places we went to when we were little
M: The warm feelings of nostalgia felt cut short by the returning school session. However, there was one thing I was looking forward to after vacation…
Natsuki: Alright!! It’s time to kick some proper butt today, got it?
Track Team: Yes captain!!
M: The annual track meet, where several schools in the prefecture come together and participate in various events. Unfortunately, we’re one of the smaller schools that participate but…
Natsuki: And don’t be intimidated by their fancy uniforms, pfft. Just shows they’re not willing to sweat in them, hehe~
Track Team: Y-Yes captain!!!
M: I don’t think Natsuki minds. Well, that or she’s afraid of whatever bet she made with her team. She seemed unbothered by previous year’s bets, but she actually seems to dread whatever they concocted. Too bad she refuses to tell me, though.
Natsuki: Alright, let’s divide up into events alright? Don’t forget to stretch. Let’s cheer each other on, kay?
Track Team: We’ll do our best Natsu!
Speaker: Participants of Event 1, please head to the center field.
MC: It’s starting… 
MC: Good luck, Natsuki.
M: …
M: Natsuki’s team clearly had improved since I first started watching them. For some events, it was a close call, but...
M:  What I appreciated was even if the event was clearly a landslide, Natsuki and her team cheered one another on with the same energy and support. 
M: Of course, Natsuki was always yelling the loudest. Even after her event, she was running around getting the girls proper water and snacks. 
M: She really tried her best. They all tried their best, but…
Natsuki: …
MC: Hey, cheer up Natsuki. You did amazing, and no other team has as much spirit as you guys did.
Natsuki: Whatever. This isn’t some cheerleading tournament, idiot. Hmph. Their smug little faces, ugh!
M: Natsuki’s team overall came 2nd... to last. Natsuki and another senior placed in top three in their respective events, but were completely outmatched in every other one.
MC: I know, I know. How about I get you a melon soda after this? Or something from that taiyaki stand?
Natsuki: Hmph, those aren’t good for you, stupid. But since you offered...
Natsuki: Is it fine we take a walk? I don’t want to go home yet.
MC: Sure.
M: Summer heat still lingered in the air, but the setting sun and slight breeze made the weather comfortable. Calm.
MC: Still upset?
Natsuki: No idiot, I’m completely fine that we just lost my last annual track meet. Yes I’m still upset!!!
MC: Okay, okay. I understand. At least your team looked like they took the defeat okay. You seemed completely unphased when you sent them off.
Natsuki: Duh. They can’t see their team captain look down. I don’t want them to be discouraged to try again next year…
M: Next year, huh? When she won’t even be there. Natsuki really loves her team, even if she’s not going to be there next year.
MC: Next year…
MC: …
Natsuki: ...sorry. I know you’re just trying to help. I’m just sad. It’s my last year, and I’m realizing a lot of things will be the last time I ever do them, so… 
MC: ...I understand. You seemed to enjoy yourself, didn’t you? Your team was definitely the rowdiest there. All the other teams looked too serious and bored.
Natsuki: Heh. I taught them well. Hopefully they’re just as obnoxiously loud next year, and carry on my legacy.
Natsuki: ...
MC: I don’t even think they’re capable of being anything but loud. But… I can understand your feelings about it ending. It’s exciting we’re going to graduate, but it’s hard knowing what we’re leaving behind. And with your attachment to this town...
MC: I’m sure it’s especially hard for you.
Natsuki: Mm… left behind… yeah, that’s what I feel.
MC: Hm?
Natsuki: N-Nothing… hey, we’ve walked this trail before, right?
MC: Hm? Yeah, I think so. 
M: Now that she mentions it, it looks really familiar. Of course, many places here give me a sense of familiarity, but this part of town in particular… feels extra nostalgic.
Natsuki: Heh. Thought you’d recognize it. It’s one of the few places in town that’s remained untouched.
Natsuki: I like to walk here to cool off. Lots of happy times here. Well, except one… b-but anyways, it’s pretty cool how it looks the same, right?
MC: Yeah… like it’s lost in time…
Natsuki: Weirdo…
Natsuki: …
M: We approach a small park. Besides the paint severely chipping off the rusted over metal…
MC: It looks… the same…
Natsuki: Hehe~ I wanted to take you here, but there wasn’t much time over summer break. It’s our ‘secret base,’ remember?
M: I give Natsuki a silent nod. Natsuki and I played here a lot after school, and even more frequently over summer vacation. Some times, Natsuki would even call a ‘secret meeting’ and throw a paper airplane into my room, telling me to come here.
MC: Good times...
M: Natsuki sat down on a swing, swaying back and forth, looking at the setting sun. It felt nice to come back here with her, after all these years.
Natsuki: It’s been nice… since you’ve been back...
MC: Yeah, it has. I didn’t realize it until we talked but, I really missed this town. Lots of… happy memories…It was good my family told me to come here. It was helpful to be supported by a familiar face, too.
Natsuki: Sh-Shut up, so sappy... you’re making it seem like we’re graduating already… 
MC: Well, it is coming up soon. 
Natsuki: Y-Yeah…
M: Sooner than I’d personally like.
Natsuki: …
M: Natsuki stands up from the swing and leans on the park fence, staring at the ground in silence.
MC: Hey… are you alright?
Natsuki: H-Huh? Yeah I’m fine, idiot. 
MC: Natsuki, I’ve known you for over ten years. You can’t fool me. 
Natsuki: ...
MC: Wait a minute. I think I know… are you down because…
Natsuki: H-Huh??? 
MC: ...of the bet?
Natsuki: O-Oh. Just that. Whew...
Natsuki: Nah. I’m off the hook for that, kinda. They said since I placed the highest they’d give me a ‘break’. But... those little demons! They’re still pushing me to do the worst part of the bet. They’re bullies, I tell you!
MC: What? Weren’t you the one yelling at me saying it was ‘tradition’ ? But hmm… only part of the bet? What was this bet that you were so afraid of, anyways?
Natsuki: …Ahaha…
Natsuki: ...
Natsuki: P-Public confession. In front of everyone. Ugh, that would’ve been terrible...
MC: Public confession? Ha! That would be… quite an interesting sight. The spunky track captain, confessing her love in such a romantic way.
MC: That’s not such a bad bet, though. You could’ve just let someone know beforehand it’s a joke. Although, you’d have to deal with some interesting rumors, that kind of stuff spreads fast in our town.
Natsuki: S-Someone? You’re not just supposed to confess to ‘someone,’ idiot. It’s a terrible bet, hmph.
MC: Wait, don’t tell me you actually have someone you’d confess to…?
Natsuki: Wh-Who says I don’t, idiot? I’m a girl too, you know…
M: I’ve been friends with Natsuki for so long, yet I’ve never really heard her talk about boys like that. I honestly can’t even imagine her doing such a romantic gesture.
M: …or maybe, I don’t want to.
M: But… since I’ve come back, we’ve spent so much time together. She would’ve told me if she liked someone, right…? Or maybe she doesn’t trust me? It’s not really like her to hide that from me, though...
M: Something doesn’t add up…
M: A familiar feeling arises. I’m going to *that* place, again, I feel it. Natsuki looks off into the distance, seemingly lost in her thoughts.
M: I want to… unlock the right thing to say. Because even if I leave this town again, even if I leave Natsuki once more
M: I don’t want the distance to grow between my childhood friend and I. Not again.
M: And this might be my last chance to prevent that.
SUMMER 4 TRUE END
M: …
M: If someone as open as Natsuki hasn’t mentioned him, then there has to be a good reason for it. As her childhood friend, the best thing I can do is support her. 
M: Even if I…
M: ...
MC: Hey Natsuki… bet or not, if you do have feelings for someone, I think you should tell him. I’m sure any guy would be happy to hear a confession from you.
Natsuki: Any guy…? 
MC: Of course. You’re the captain of an amazing track team, and even if your words sound crass, it’s no doubt you care about others. Plus, I can affirm you’re an amazing friend so… it’s no doubt you’d be an amazing girlfriend.
M: And… the way she loves this town and the memories with it… 
M: Yeah, that soft side of hers will definitely be cherished by someone.
Natsuki: B-But… you really think my crush is just any guy, idiot???
MC: N-No I just--
Natsuki: C-Cause he’s not just any guy, okay!? He’s… not just a regular c-crush…
Natsuki: He’s someone who, even after not talking a long time, can pick up right where we left off. As if no time had passed since we last met. 
Natsuki: He’s the kind of person who… even when he was h-hurting, took the time to tell me about his mother passing in a tactful way… so I wouldn’t get hurt. He always thinks of others…
Natsuki: A-And! He’s the kind of person that would understand why my grades were failing instead of nag me for it. Someone I can talk to about the nostalgia of simply going to the store, and won’t laugh at me…
MC: N-Natsuki, are you saying…?
Natsuki: I-I’m only doing this because I don’t want to look like a wuss to my team, okay? It’s tradition…
Natsuki: S-So…
Natsuki: I like you, idiot. I’ve liked you all this time.
MC: Natsuki…
Natsuki: I don’t want a reply or anything, though! Not until we graduate, at least… I want to make more memories as friends until the end of high school… okay?
M: All of this… time? Even since we were little…? Natsuki… I always thought you were an open book. I can’t help but feel a bit… 
M: Happy
MC: Okay, Natsuki. I want to make more memories too. But… promise me we can have more memories after high school too? Because…
Natsuki: Sh-Shut it! I don’t want a reply yet, and I mean it!!!!
MC: Fine, fine. Whatever you wish.
Natsuki: H-Hey! Is that attitude you’re giving me? Pfft. What a ladies man, right after I confess to you too, hmph.
MC: Confession? Sorry, the only confessions I accept are the ones I can actually reply to.
Natsuki: Y-You…! I may like you, but I also really hate you, you know that?
M: Heh. Natsuki, please don’t ever change.
MC: I know, I know. I don’t hate you though, so… I made curry for us to eat. If you want to have some at my house.
Natsuki: Curry!? Oooh I’m craving some home-cooked food, let’s go let’s go! When did you learn to cook that, though?
M: After talking to Natsuki about memories and this town.... I’ve thought a lot. Even after ten years, she still cherished the memories we made together. She treated me with the same friendliness, as if no time had even passed.
M: It made me think about… what it means to treasure something, even when it’s gone. 
MC: Recently, about a month or two now? A little while back, I decided to call my Dad and ask him if he had any of Mom’s recipes.
Natsuki: R-Really…?
MC: Yeah, so help me out. I want it to one day taste the way it did back then, when my mom made it for us. 
Natsuki: ...We’ll see about that, idiot.
M: Since I’ve returned, all the changes to this town on top of living alone has made this nostalgic little town still feel unfamiliar to me. But… 
M: Hearing Natsuki talk about the little things she loves about this town, and reminding me of the fond memories I’ve left behind here… I remembered what made this town feel like home.
M: Instead of being afraid of the past, I want to embrace it. Like Natsuki. I want to continue making memories.
Young MC: Let’s get going, Natsu.
M: With you.
M: …
Natsuki: Secret base meeting has started! Today’s course of action is: Operation Run Away!
MC: Natsu, you can’t come with me. My mom already said you can’t and your parents got mad last time you ran to my house. 
Natsuki: B-But… what will I do? You’re l-leaving me behind… 
MC: Natsu… sorry… it’s up to my parents. I’m only in grade school, I can’t stay here alone.
Natsuki: I-I know! So that’s why Operation Run Away--
MC: Natsu… Natsuki. We have to grow up at some point, we can’t play pretend forever.
Natsuki: Hmph…
MC: ...How about, instead of Operation Run Away, we do Operation Run To Your Future. My future is somewhere else, and yours is here. One day, I’m sure we’ll see eachother again, but...
MC: Your future is here, okay?
Natsuki: F-Fine! I hate you!! 
MC: N-Natsuki…
M: She yells at me and runs off, and that was the last I saw her. My elementary school eyes filled with tears. I knew she didn’t mean it. She was just hurt… It was the night before I was supposed to move with my family to the city, after all.
M: But to be honest… I was too. I was hurt, too. Who would want to lose such a precious friend? I even had to stop calling her by her nickname ‘Natsu,’ because each time I did, it reminded me… who I was losing.
M: With Natsu’s hot-headed ideas, I always had to be the rational one, but… when she came up with ‘Operation Run Away’...
M: A large part of me didn’t want to be the rational one, anymore. 
MC: Keep running, Natsu…
MC: One day I’ll come back.
SUMMER 4 GOOD END
M: …
M: If someone as open as Natsuki hasn’t mentioned him, then there has to be a good reason for it. As her childhood friend, the best thing I can do is support her. 
MC: Hey Natsuki… bet or not, if you do have feelings for someone, I think you should tell him. I’m sure any guy would be happy to hear a confession from you.
Natsuki: Any guy…? 
MC: Of course. You’re the captain of an amazing track team, and even if your words sound crass, it’s no doubt you care about others. Plus, I personally know you’re an amazing friend so…
Natsuki: You really think my crush is just any guy, idiot???
MC: N-No I just-- 
Natsuki: C-Cause he’s not just any guy, okay? He’s… He’s….
Natsuki: Someone I’ve known forever. He’s someone that accepts all the quirks that even my parents get tired of. 
Natsuki: ...
Natsuki: He’s the kind of person you can never forget, even after a long time...
MC: a long…time...?
Natsuki: S-Stupid! He’s special ‘cause he’s such a huge idiot that he doesn’t even realize his childhood has been in love with him all this time. That’s who my crush is, got it?
MC: N-Natsu--
Natsuki: Sh-Shut it! I don’t have to confess to him, remember? I didn’t lose the bet, and… I don’t think I’d want a reply, yet...
Natsuki: Because even though he’s too slow for his own good, I love him because of the memories we’ve made as friends. And I want to make more memories with this person, just like that. At least until the end of high school…
M: All this time…? She’s thought of me that way…?
MC: Natsuki...
Natsuki: …
Natsuki: H-Hey… no need to be quiet. It’s not like it’s a confession or anything…it’s a non-confession, alright? A non-confession! 
M: Natsuki… even when you’re flustered, you brighten the mood.
MC: Oh? Alright. Well, here’s my non-reply.
MC: Let’s graduate together like you promised. And…
MC: Maybe, you can just do a normal confession next time.
Natsuki: Wh-Whatever. Of course we’re graduating together, I’m not failing out ya know!
Natsuki: A-And hey, don’t tell anyone about this… okay…?
MC: Of course, don’t be silly. Hey, it’s getting dark. Let’s start heading back.
Natsuki: Not before you buy me melon soda on the way back, you owe me!
M: Since I’ve returned, all the changes to this town on top of living alone has made this nostalgic little town still feel unfamiliar to me. But… 
M: Hearing Natsuki talk about the little things she loves about this town, and reminding me of the fond memories I’ve left behind here… I remembered what made this town feel like home.
M: Even when I leave this place again, even when I leave Natsuki behind, again… I want to continue searching for that feeling. That feeling of home.
M: The feeling I get with...
M: …
Natsuki: Secret base meeting has started! Today’s course of action is: Operation Run Away!
MC: Natsu, you can’t come with me. My mom already said you can’t and your parents got mad last time you ran to my house. 
Natsuki: B-But… what will I do? You’re l-leaving me behind… 
MC: Natsu… sorry… it’s up to my parents. I’m only in grade school, I can’t stay here alone.
Natsuki: I-I know! So that’s why Operation Run Away--
MC: Natsu… Natsuki. We have to grow up at some point, we can’t play pretend forever.
Natsuki: Hmph…
MC: ...How about, instead of Operation Run Away, we do Operation Run To Your Future. My future is somewhere else, and yours is here. One day, I’m sure we’ll see eachother again, but
MC: Your future is here, okay?
Natsuki: F-Fine! I hate you!! 
MC: N-Natsuki...
Natsuki M: That was the last day he called me Natsu. He said it sounded to childish, and since we were graduating elementary school, he felt like we needed to grow up. I’ve always liked the nickname, though… even now.
Natsuki M: But even at the time, I knew we couldn’t play pretend forever. I knew we would have to grow up at some point, and stop playing around as if we were living in an endless summer vacation. 
Natsuki M: But… when he told me to run towards my future instead of running away...
Natsuki: Idiot… you’re my future too, so…
Natsuki: I’ll keep running.

SUMMER 4 BAD END
M: My last chance…
M: I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t figure it out. I want to support her, but I don’t know the right thing to say. If she wanted me to know… she’d just tell me, right? I shouldn’t medle in her business like that…
M: After all, it’s been ten years. Of course she likes someone.
M: …
MC: H-Ha, I see. Good thing you don’t have to tell him publicly, then! 
Natsuki: Y-Yeah…
Natsuki: You’re right, it is a good thing. I… like him so much, I’d rather deal with unrequited love than break our special bond.
MC: I see…
M: Sounds like she really cares about him. Natsuki and I share everything together, but… we’re getting older. I’m not the only person in Natsuki’s life, and with all the time that’s passed, it’s inevitable that I won’t always be the closest one, anymore.
M: I’m happy for her, though. Really… I am.
Natsuki: Yeah, I’m glad you understand. You know how I love this town, right?
MC: Of course.
Natsuki: Well… he’s part of why I love this town so much. Even if he’s not always in it, even if the old places we used to go to are torn down, even if this town is practically unrecognizable… I still pass by places that have our old memories, lingering.
Natsuki: Memories where he and I made memories, together.
Natsuki: So even if this town won’t have that special person anymore, even though I’m sure he’ll leave again and never come back, having those memories will be enough. Because that’s what makes home for me. The memories.
M: Home…
M: I haven’t really felt ‘home’ in a long time. Even before I moved here, and even after I moved back to this nostalgic town. Talking to Natsuki, however, made me remember what home felt like. It motivated me to want to find it again.
M:  I want to continue searching for that feeling. That feeling of home. 
M: I hope… Natsuki can find that feeling again, too. If her heart is with someone else that isn’t in this town, I can only support her from a distance. After all, the feeling I’m searching for 
M: Might not be here...
