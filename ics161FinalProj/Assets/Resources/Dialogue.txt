SPRING 3
M: Midterms were handed back today. More than half the term already passed by… 
M: I look down at my paper, clearly marked with a red 73.
MC: Barely made it… 
MC: I wonder how Haruka did…
Student A: Haruka wait!! 
Student B: Haruka!
M: A small commotion emerges from the corner of the classroom. By the time I look over, I see two girls standing up from their desks, and another girl with pink hair run out the room with papers in her hand.
MC: Haruka…?
M: I jolt out of my seat and head over to the students that called out her name. I’ve seen them around Haruka before, they must be her close friends.
MC: What happened…?
Student A: I don’t know! She got her test back and went all silent… then ran off without saying anything...
Student B: She’s left like that before. Albeit, not as dramatic as this…
Student A: I’m worried!! Should we go find her? We never know where she goes…
M: I let the two girls talk amongst themselves. My focus is finding Haruka… it seems really out of character for her to leave like that.
MC: Where would she go, though?
M: My mind flashes back to our previous conversations and interactions.
Haruka: I’ll show you the library first, its my favorite place… 
MC: That’s right! The library… 
M: I run out of the classroom and down the hall, recounting the way Haruka showed me the first day I came to this school 
M: ...and finally, I arrive to the familiar room, and see a pink fluff of hair in the corner table.
MC: Haruka…?
Haruka: !!
Haruka: O-Oh… it’s you… 
M: Her eyes appeared puffy and red. She sniffles a few times as I walk over.
MC: Are you okay...?
Haruka: Ahaha… yeah… just didn’t do that well and… yeah, haha…
Haruka: Sorry for creating such a commotion back there. I just needed some air…
MC: Hmm…
MC: You know, you can talk to me about your problems Haruka. I’m your friend.
Haruka: …
Haruka: … thank you … 
M: Haruka’s tone dims, and the usual cheerful ring to her voice is gone. The last time I heard Haruka sound like this was when we first had lunch together, and she told me about her father. I could tell something was wrong.
Haruka: ...it’s just that… I’ve never really been that great at school. I tried but, I always liked to do other things, like meet people or draw… 
Haruka: But after I finished middle school, and my Mom went back to work... I just see her work so hard. I can’t idle away while she’s working so hard for us… 
MC: I see…
Haruka: So I decided I’d get into a good college and make good money in an office, just like my Mom. So that she doesn’t have to work so hard all the time. I study and study, and my grades really have improved but… 
M: Haruka looks at her paper. I could see her eyes appear shinier, as if she’s holding back tears.
Haruka: With grades like these, I don’t know how I’ll be able to do any of that… 
MC: Haruka… 
M: My chest started to fill with sorrow. She’s definitely been studying so hard… for the sake of others… 
M: I want to say something comforting. I need to go back *there*. I need to unlock the right words… now more than ever… 
SPRING 3 GOOD END
MC: Haruka… you’re too hard on yourself.
Haruka: Eh? 
M: The words came out even before Haruka could fizzle back into my vision. Once again, that *place* has guided me.  
MC: You think of everyone else’s happiness all the time, and don’t give yourself enough credit. You said you struggled before, right? So… since you’ve made progress…
MC: You should be proud.
Haruka: …
Haruka: You’re so kind, you know… 
Haruka: I’m still pretty sad right now, so I probably can’t feel it yet but… 
Haruka: Thank you… you’re right… I should be proud.
Haruka: To be honest, I… I can’t really imagine myself cooped up in a corporate building. My mom complains about work meetings and conflict all the time, yet she’s able to lead all those people… 
Haruka: I just can’t really see myself doing that. My mom always said I took after my father in that way… he was a freelance creative writer. A ‘free bird,’ she’d call it 
Haruka: I always thought I’d be like that too, but with art. But…
M: Haruka shifts around uncomfortably, looking down at the ground.
Haruka: But… I can’t support my family doing that.
MC: But your dad…? Didn’t he support you guys when he was a writer?
Haruka: Mhm, yeah… but that was because he worked freelance for years, so he was able to build a loyal clientele. I don’t want to make my mom wait for that… 
Haruka: So, I decided I’d throw that dream away, for the sake of my mom… and my brother too, of course. I want him to be able to chase his dreams, and be happy.
MC: But…
MC: What about your happiness? 
Haruka: Hm?
MC: Your mom, doesn’t she work hard for you? I’m sure of it… the fact she taught you all her recipes and works long hours... she wants you to be happy. I don’t know her but
MC: I have a feeling she wouldn’t want to hear her daughter say that she’s throwing away her dreams for the sake of her mother.
MC: There’s something that I really admire about your altruism, Haruka. But, I think you should remember that
MC: It’s okay to live for yourself, too.
Haruka: Ah…
M: I made sure my words were said with certainty, out of hope she would believe them too. I may have just met Haruka this year but… she has already shown me so much kindness.
M: Despite going through similar tragic events, she still thinks of others. While I… just let time pass by. In my own world.
M: So this time, I want to make something out of my hurt. I want to be like Haruka, and use it to help others. Especially her.
Haruka: … I was wrong about you… 
MC: H-Huh?
Haruka: At the road with the cherry blossoms… I called you dark, remember?
M: I do. She giggles. Typical Haruka... even when she’s sad.
Haruka: Now you’re the one being optimistic, and I’m gloomy.
Haruka: But… you’re right. You’ve never met my mom but, she’d totally scold the crap out of me for talking like that!!
M: I can’t help but smile. 
MC: I told you so. C’mon, I’m sure she’d be proud of your score. And wherever you end up going to college.  
M: I’m also sure she’ll just be proud of raising someone so hardworking and kind, Haruka.
Haruka: Hehe… 
M: Haruka lets out a relieved sigh.
Haruka: Aaah, I do like the library but, it’s so stuffy! Want to celebrate the end of midterms with me? I’m feeling ice cream…
MC: Haha, of course. Except there’s not much to celebrate for me, I barely passed… 
Haruka: Ehhhh? O-Oh no!! I’m sorry!! Here I was complaining…. 
MC: Don’t worry about it Haruka. Let’s go out and celebrate like you said. Oh and maybe before we go, tell your friends you’re okay? They seemed pretty worried.
Haruka: Th-they were? I feel bad… but I’ll tell them. Alright, let’s head out!
M: We grab our things and leave the library.
M: Today I learned a lot about Haruka. During my short time here, I was able to learn a lot about her, and learned so much from her. She’s helped me view so many things differently.
M: And today… I was able to return the favor.
M: I think… I would like to continue returning the favor, for a very long time.
SPRING 3 BAD END
MC: It’s okay, I failed too. You’re not alone.
M: After coming back from that *place*, that was all I could muster up. I couldn’t collect all the keys to understanding Haruka… 
Haruka: Eh?? I’m sorry! Here I am complaining, not thinking about how it would sound.
MC: Oh no, that’s not what… 
Haruka: No no, you’re right. It does pull me back into reality knowing that others are in the same boat as I am. Thank you… 
MC: …
M: It doesn’t feel quite right saying ‘You’re Welcome’
M: I shouldn’t have said that… sure, that might have made other people felt better, but…
M: If I understood Haruka better… I would instantly realize that Haruka would just worry about my score instead. So I ended up not comforting her at all… 
Haruka: It’s okay, don’t be sad! Let’s just focus on the fact midterms are over. We can both improve next time!
MC: Y-Yeah… 
Haruka: How about we go get ice cream, hm? My treat! 
M: We head out of the library. I am happy to see Haruka not… so sad, but… 
M: It doesn’t take a genius to figure out she’s trying to cheer me up instead. Somehow, my efforts were counter-intuitive.
M: I’m sorry, Haruka. You’ve showed me so much, and made my time here so pleasant, but…
M: I couldn’t even return the favor… 

SPRING 4
Teacher: ...these youthful years will be coming to an end soon. 
Teacher: But before then, don’t slack off!! Exams are almost upon us! Don’t forget to turn in assignments 3.2-3.4 by the end of this week too!
M: Almost a whole term has passed by since I’ve moved back to my childhood town. I’ve changed so much and experienced so much in this short time that I almost forgot that... eventually it would come to an end.
M: The seed of worry was planted the first time college exams were mentioned. And since then, slowly I’ve spent more and more time realizing I won’t be here forever.
M: I tried to tuck those thoughts away and spend time doing other things, like learning piano, visiting cafes, meeting new people
M: And of course, spending time with Haruka. Since midterms, Haruka has been keen on having me try her food often, so we usually spend lunch together.
M: We always have so much to talk about that we end up finishing our conversations after class so... I usually just walk her home now.
M: It’s a routine I’ve grown accustomed to. 
M: But...
M: Even these happy moments can’t stop time.
M: Soon, my high school years will be over.
M: And soon, we will go our separate ways. These happy times, in this town, at this school, will never happen again. 
M: I tell myself, that’s just something I have to accept. Time is fleeting. Just like Haruka said about the cherry blossoms last Spring, I should appreciate the temporary things even more…
MC: Before they go...
MC: But I don’t want them to go… 
M: Appreciation only goes so far... I can deal with admiring cherry blossoms from afar, until they dwindle away and the season is over. But Haruka--
Haruka: Hey!
MC: H-Huh?
M: Haruka giggles in front of me. 
Haruka: You’re completely out of it, hehe. I asked if we’re still walking home today?
MC: …
M: These are the moments I don’t want to lose. No matter how mundane, I don’t want these simple things to be... temporary…
MC: Yeah... sorry. I was just thinking…
MC: Do you think we could make a detour on the way home?
Haruka: Hm? Sure, sounds fun! Where did you want to go?
MC: ...secret.
M: Without saying much, we grabbed our bags and headed out. I led the way to somewhere I haven’t been in a while.
Haruka: Hmm? You’re really set on keeping it a secret, huh?
MC: Ha... sorry. We’re almost there.
M: We make our way to a paved path, not too far from the school. A path that isn’t so popular around this time of the year.
M: But there, to me, it will always be Spring. There doesn’t need to be cherry blossoms in full bloom for me to come here. Because... of the memories attached to this place.
M: The people attached to this place.
Haruka: Oh!
M: The bare trees come into view. We stop and look at the trees, dull and colorless.
Haruka: Hehe, I see. This is where we first met, isn’t it?
MC: Mhm…
M: Haruka looks at the trees as if they were dotted with blossoms still.
Haruka: It’s almost the end of the school term... 
MC: Yeah… it is, isn’t it…
MC: Haruka…
Haruka: Hm? 
MC: ...I wanted to take you here to say…
MC: Thank you.
Haruka: Thank you? 
MC: For that one day... the first time we met, here. I’ve thought about that conversation a lot, you know… do you remember?
Haruka: Hehe. Of course I do! We talked about the blossoms, and how they don’t last.
MC: Yes. You talked about their temporariness in such a positive way. 
MC: Before then, I resented time, including the moving seasons, and anything that wasn’t permanent... but
MC: You helped me see the good in those things. And how to turn it into appreciation. In the way that you do.
Haruka: O-Oh! I’m happy my words... had that effect…
M: Haruka gets flustered. She’s not really good with compliments. You’ve had a lot of impact on me, Haruka. 
MC: Moving time is the only thing guaranteed in life. But I was afraid of the only thing that wasn’t temporary. The only thing that... could take things away... 
MC: But... you also knew that pain. Yet were somehow so cheerful all the time, and helpful... it made me really wonder, how? How are you okay with time passing by, when everything you know might disappear tomorrow
Haruka: Ah...
MC: But, by spending all this time with you, I think... I see how. I couldn’t see it then but, I’ve changed. I’ve...  been healing... Because time passed by... 
M: Because time passed by with you…
Haruka: Hehe. You really have, changed
Haruka: I think time passing truly is a scary thing. But you’re right, it’s the only thing we’re guaranteed in this life. But it’s a good thing, I think
Haruka: Because time passing means we have time to heal, and time to find happier things.
M: But...
Haruka: Like you! If time just stopped, I would have never met you.
M: But!
Haruka: So I’m grateful for time. Even if it has taken away things precious to me. I am still grateful.
M: But!!!
M: But it takes away so much too, Haruka! 
M: My fists clench. This moment, right now, I am so terribly happy. But that happiness is what makes me so terribly afraid.
M: I’m afraid. But... I don’t want to ruin this... moment with her. 
M: I have to go to *that* place again. I have to know the right thing to say. So I can treasure this moment properly.
M: Please, guide me again.
SPRING 4 TRUE END
Haruka: ...which is why I think, we should enjoy time--
MC: Even if it takes away you?
Haruka: E-Eh?
MC: I’ve… taken your advice, I really have. I’m cherishing all this time we’re spending together but…
MC: But...!
M: That *place* each time... helped me find the words to learn the most about Haruka. The subtleties of her that have helped me see... her truest self... 
MC: You purposely took the time to show me around because you didn’t want me to hurt how you did... you are always hiding your true feelings, like me, because we don’t know how to express them... 
MC: But somehow, we learned to express them to each other. That is too special to me to lose.
MC: And you... you even considered giving up your happiness, your dreams of doing art, for others. For your family.
MC: I can forgive time for taking away cherry blossoms, because they’ll just come back next year, but... 
MC: I can even forgive time for taking away my precious time with you at school, walking home, trying your lunches…
MC: But I can’t forgive time... if it means...
MC: Taking away... you.
M: Haruka looked at me with a stunned face. I don’t know what came over me but... 
M: I don’t regret it. Haruka is a precious friend. She’s more than that, she’s... a confidant. Someone I can trust. Someone I deeply care about. I shouldn’t hide my feelings around her.
Haruka: ...I’m...glad…
MC: H-Huh?
M: Haruka says in a quiet voice. I could barely hear her words.
Haruka: I’m... I’m glad you said that
Haruka: Because... I’m afraid too.
MC: !
Haruka: I’m afraid of time taking away things, again, too. I’m afraid of not seeing my friends after graduation. I’m afraid of starting a new life again. I’m afraid...
Haruka: I’m afraid of losing you, too.
MC: Haruka…
Haruka: I’m afraid. You’re right, this school term, we’ve become so close. I’m able to express myself freely, around you. You helped me do that. You even helped me... 
Haruka: Chase my dreams... 
Haruka: After our conversation at the library, I applied to many art schools and…
Haruka: I just got accepted into a really promising one... so thank you.
MC: R-Really? That’s fantastic!! I’m so happy for you... 
Haruka: Hehe... I wouldn’t have found the courage to do so, if we hadn’t talked that one time in the library. 
Haruka: But... 
Haruka: Even with all these things to look forward to though, I still felt afraid. Not knowing if... you’d be there... 
M: My chest felt full. I am so happy in this moment. Hearing her... feel the same way that I do... I somehow feel less afraid.
MC: Haruka... no matter where we end up, I won’t let time take you away. I’ll still talk to you. Even if it isn’t every day like how we’re used to, I’ll still... make memories with you.
Haruka: Really?
M: I give her a smile and a nod. Haruka is usually the one teaching me things about myself, giving comfort... so I feel warm inside the few times I get to be the one who gives reassurance.
MC: I’m still worried, of course but... since you feel the same way... 
MC: I don’t have to be afraid of time taking you away. If we both keep in touch, right?
Haruka: Hehe. You’re right. There’s nothing to be afraid of
Haruka: Because remember? I said ‘Let’s get along’ that one day. I didn’t give any expiration date for that!
MC: Heh. Alright, now that that’s out of the way…
MC: Let’s get ice cream at that one place we went to after midterms. To celebrate you getting into art school!
Haruka: !!! That sounds good! Even if it’s cold, it’s been a while since we’ve been there
MC: Yeah, thought you’d like that. What school are you going to, anyways?
Haruka: Oh yeah! H Art School, it’s pretty far... 
MC: H!!?
Haruka: Hm? Do you know of it? It’s not that well known... 
MC: U-Uh... 
MC: ...No, sorry, I was mistaken. A-Anyways, what ice cream flavor should I get this time? Haha...
M: H Art School is where my dad lives. Where I’ll be going back, after I finish high school. Time passing is strange but... fate is even stranger, isn’t it?
M: I’ll find the right time to tell her, but
M: for now, I am content. In this little place, even though it’s winter and the trees lack color and the sky is dim
M: It’s Spring, to me. I’m back to where the cherry blossoms are in full blossom. I’m back to starting a new term. I’m back to my first day at school.
M: And I’m back to where I first met Haruka.
M: Those things... will never be temporary to me. 
M: Because I’ll always have those memories of last Spring.
M: And just like the cherry blossoms that come back every Spring…
M: I know we will cross paths again.

SPRING 4 GOOD END
Haruka: ...which is why I think, we should enjoy time--
MC: Even if it takes away you?
Haruka: E-Eh?
MC: I’ve… taken your advice, I really have. I’m cherishing all this time we’re spending together but…
MC: I can’t help but think of after we graduate, you know? No more walking home together... no more tasting your homemade lunches... 
MC: I can forgive time for taking away cherry blossoms, because they’ll just come back next year, but... 
MC: What about time taking away... you…?
M: Haruka looked at me with a stunned face. I don’t know what came over me but... 
M: I don’t regret it. Haruka is a precious friend. I shouldn’t hide my feelings around her.
Haruka: ...I’m...glad…
MC: H-Huh?
M: Haruka says in a quiet voice. I could barely hear her words.
Haruka: I’m... I’m glad you said that
Haruka: Because... I’m afraid too.
MC: !
Haruka: I’m afraid of time taking away things, again, too. I’m afraid of not seeing my friends after graduation. I’m afraid of starting a new life again. I’m afraid...
Haruka: I’m afraid of losing you, too.
MC: Haruka...
Haruka: And I wish I could guarantee that these times wouldn’t end, but I can’t do that. I can’t even convince myself that, but...
Haruka: Surely if... time led me to meet you. I’m sure... 
Haruka: It will lead me to you, again.
MC: Haha... that is so much like you, you know.
M: That’s right. Time led me to her, too. I don’t know where we’ll be going after graduation. I don’t even know if our paths will even cross again. 
M: Of course, I want them to, but... 
M: For now, I am content. In this little place, even though it’s winter and the trees lack color and the sky is dim
M: It’s Spring, to me. I’m back to where the cherry blossoms are in full blossom. I’m back to starting a new term. I’m back to my first day at school.
M: And I’m back to where I first met Haruka.
M: Those things... will never be temporary to me. 
M: Because after this, even if time passes by, and I never see Haruka again, even if we never cross paths or say a word to each other after this wonderful moment
M: I will always, always... 
M: Have those memories from last Spring.
SPRING 4 BAD END
Haruka: ...which is why I think, we should enjoy time, while it’s in the present.
MC: ...
M: I went back to that place but... I couldn’t do it.
M: I can’t ruin this moment. And like Haruka said... I should just enjoy the moment now.
MC: You’re right... there’s nothing to be afraid of. Thank you for coming here, Haruka.
Haruka: A-Ah... yeah, of course!
MC: ...hey...next Spring... 
MC: I wonder what will be different about this town... and how this place will look again, when the cherry blossoms are in bloom
Haruka: Ah, yeah! Our high school was new, so who knows what else might be new next year, hehe.
Haruka: At least we know the cherry blossoms will be pretty, just like last spring, right?
MC: Mhm, definitely.
M: Next Spring... 
M: I wonder where we’ll be. Perhaps she’ll still be here, in this little town... helping her mom out... enjoying family and friends
M: And maybe I’ll be in a university far away. Maybe I’ll forget about the short year, back in this town... I turn to Haruka. 
Haruka: Hm?
M: No... I can’t forget her. At least, not yet, not right now... 
M: Because right now even though it’s winter and the trees lack color and the sky is dim
M: It’s Spring, to me. I’m back to where the cherry blossoms are in full blossom. I’m back to starting a new term. I’m back to my first day at school.
M: And I’m back to where I first met Haruka.
M: Haruka, it’s going to hurt when we go our separate ways. It’s going to hurt like hell, but
M: Even if those things are temporary... 
M: The barren trees prove to me how dull life would be without temporary treasures in life.
M: So if somehow, we cross paths again, just like that Spring day we met... 
M: Please reach out to me again.
