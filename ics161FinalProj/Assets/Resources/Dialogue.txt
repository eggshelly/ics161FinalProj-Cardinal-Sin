SUMMER 1
M: The weather was fair and sunny, a perfect day to check out the school’s field. 
MC: Maybe there will be sport clubs practicing today, if I’m lucky…
M: I walk to an open field, the sun basking lightly on the fresh green grass. I could hear faint cheering and yelling.
Natsuki: Hey…!!! Hey you!!!! 
MC: ??? 
M: I hear a small yet aggressive voice call out in my direction. Is she talking to… me?? 
M: A girl runs off the track circle excitedly towards my direction, her golden ponytail contrasting with the bright blue hues of the sky. 
Natsuki: C’mon, I was waving to you stupid!!
M: Ok. She’s definitely talking to me but… 
M: The peculiar girl notices my discomfort and confusion. Maybe we really did meet? I feel like I would’ve recognized someone this… er,
M: ...noticeable… 
MC: Hi…? 
M: The sunny girl responds with a displeased pout. 
Natsuki: Is that our school uniform?? How could you not tell me you were transferring here? 
M: This girl is not getting it. 
M: My best bet is to just play along.
MC: Y-Yeah, I moved here recently. Are you on the track team? 
M: She gives me a skeptical look. 
Natsuki: Hmmph, you sure changed. 
Natsuki: Anyways, yeah. I’m the girl’s track captain now.
M: She smiles proudly at her statement.
MC: Wow, that’s pretty cool! Is the school’s team any good?
Natsuki: Eh??? I m-mean… we haven’t won any titles but…
M: Her off-guard demeanor abruptly turns into anger. She shoots a fiery glare.
Natsuki: They try really hard ok??? Don’t disrespect my team! 
MC: Oh wait no I wasn’t-- 
Natsuki: Anyways, you haven’t told me, why didn’t you tell me you were transferring back here?
Natsuki: You don’t even seem excited to see me… after all these years… 
M: Her bright demeanor dims to a single candle, and her voice lowers for the first time in our meeting.
M: Crap… now I feel bad… 
M: She said after all these years though... 
M: I dig my brain for answers.
M: Who could she be…? 
SUMMER 1 GOOD END
M: And then, a flood of childhood memories instantly hit me. 
MC: !!! 
MC: Natsuki? Natsuki Kawakami? 
M: Natsuki’s face lights up instantly.
Natsuki: Yeah you big idiot!! What took you so long??? 
Natsuki: Hmmph, whatever. I guess I have matured into quite the beauty, fufufu~
M: Wrong. Well, at least her height hasn’t changed much. 
M: However, she has certainly…
M: changed...
M: Natsuki and I grew up together in this town, and I spent the majority of my summer vacations with her.
M: That is, until I moved away. 
M: She cried a bunch of tears that day, and yelled at her parents for not letting her come with me.
M: I let out a relieving sigh. With all the cosmetic changes to my hometown, it was reassuring to something familiar. 
MC: Heh, I guess you have grown up a bit. And wow, look at you! You’re track captain now. 
MC: I remember you always loved the outdoors as a kid. We really got into some trouble because of some of your ideas, you know. 
Natsuki: My ideas??? It’s only because your baby butt BEGGED to come along. 
M: Wrong, again. She always clinged to me. But she never liked to admit it. 
Natsuki: Anyways, don’t be a stranger. We’re schoolmates now, kay?? I have to get back to practice. 
MC: Definitely. It was nice to see you again, Natsuki.
Natsuki: Hmmph, whatever. 
M: Her dismissive words contradicted the smile that I knew she was holding back. 
M: It truly was nice to see her again. 
SUMMER 1 BAD END 
M: I tried and tried to think but…
M: I just couldn’t remember who she was.
MC: I’m really sorry, but…
MC: Who... are you...?
M: As the words left my mouth, I could see a hint of hurt appear on the girl’s face. 
Natsuki: … Natsuki. Natsuki Kawakami.
M: As soon as she said her name, I felt a flood of nostalgia take over. 
M: Natsuki and I grew up together, and I spent the majority of my summer vacations with her.
M: That is, until I moved away. 
M: She cried a bunch of tears that day, and yelled at her parents for not letting her come with me.
M: How could I forget? 
MC: Natsuki, shoot. Of course I remember! It’s so nice to be in the same school again.  
Natsuki: Idiot! Not nice enough for you to remember, I guess. Hmph. 
Natsuki: ...It is nice to see your big dumb face again too. 
MC: Heh. I’m sorry though, for not realizing earlier. 
Natsuki: Whatever, I don’t care. It’s been years anyways, I just remembered you c-cause… 
Natsuki: Cause who else has an idiot face like you! I could spot it a mile a way…
M: Those words hung in the air. They didn’t mean to but, they made me feel even more ashamed. 
Natsuki: A-Anyways… I have to go back to practice so… 
Natsuki: Feel free to show your stupid face here again. If you want. 
M: She runs off before I could say anything back. 
MC: Natsuki…
MC: Sorry…
