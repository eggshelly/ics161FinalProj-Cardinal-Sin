SUMMER 2
M: Weeks have flown by since I’ve moved back to my hometown. The weather is getting warmer, the days longer... giving me a little bit too much time on my hands. Luckily, I’ve met people here and there, but... 
M: As a new student in their senior year, it gets a bit lonely. So on days where I feel a little homesick, I go see the person who’s most familiar to me.
Natsuki: Let’s go!!!! You got this Ritsu!! Keep up the good work, Chiaki!
Track Girl A: Uwahh, lucky you got complimented by Natsu... 
Track Girl B: Hehe~
Natsuki: Ritsu! Watch your form, I don’t want you to hurt yourself again kay?
Track Girl A: Y-Yes captain!
M: Heh. Natsuki is still as loud as ever. Never really shys away from anything, including motivating her teammates. I was a bit surprised to hear she was the team captain, but... 
Natsuki: Let’s go let’s go~ That’s a whole 32 second improvement!! Let’s wind down with stretches, don’t die one me yet!
M: ...she’s actually a really inspiring leader. Whenever I wait  for her after school, I can tell her teammates really respect her. It’s strange to see this side of her... she spent most of our childhood making reckless plans
M: ...and roping me into said reckless plans.
M: Now, she seems really focused and passionate about something other than getting both of us in trouble.
Natsuki: Aaalright! That’s it for today, don’t forget to hydrate your bodies, don’t want to see any of you dead on the way home, fufu~ 
Natsuki: And oh, Mayu, you’re looking kind of pale. Maybe get some extra rest, got it?
Track Girl C: Will do, captain. Thanks Natsu!
Track Girls: Thanks for the hard work Natsu!!
M: Natsuki makes her way over to me, still looking full of energy despite the long workout. 
Natsuki: Hey idiot, why don’t you join us for a run some time? Bet my girls could outrun you, fufu~
MC: Unfortunately, I don’t doubt that. Aren’t you tired? Today’s practice seemed longer than usual. Let’s go sit by the vending machines, I’ll buy you melon soda.
Natsuki: Ehhh? I’m an athlete now you stupid head!
MC: Oh, I guess that’s right. I just figured since that was your favorite before.
Natsuki: ... 
Natsuki: Sh-shut up, I’ll take it. You owe me for not telling me you moved back, anyways. Hmph.
MC: Ah… sorry...
M: We sit at a nearby bench, and I buy her a melon soda and myself a black coffee. The past few weeks, we’ve spent catching up on all of the mundane things we’ve missed from each others life since I’ve left, reminiscing on old times…
M: For the first time in over a year, I’ve been able to recount old memories of this town without feeling overwhelmingly sad. I smile, holding the melon soda in my hand.
MC: How nostalgic.
M: In grade school, whenever Natsuki was having a bad day, I’d buy her favorite drink and tell her to meet me after school.
M: We’d sit on a bench, and Natsuki would just talk on and on, unfiltered, about whatever was bothering her. I was never really good at that...
Natsuki: What’s taking you so long, idiot? Forgot how to use countryside vending machines you city boy? Heheheh.
M: ...even if it lacks tact, at times.
MC: I’m coming, I’m coming. Here, take this.
Natsuki: Uwahhh! So refreshing, I haven’t had soda in so long. Have to keep my athletic physique up, yaknow?
Natsuki: This soda brings me back, though. I’m surprised I didn’t become a glutton with how much soda we drank when we were kids, heh. Anyways, I was thinking~ 
Natsuki: It’s been a while since I’ve seen your family, can I come over to visit some time?
MC: … 
M: I’ve been doing my best to avoid this topic, but… 
Natsuki: Oh oh and when I come, can you tell your mom to make her special curry next time? I haven’t had it in foreverrr~ 
M: Growing up, Natsuki’s parents weren’t as understanding of her trouble-making behavior, so she’d often come over when they would fight. My mom... was a patient woman who adored Natsuki, even her impulsive ways, so...
M:  She was like a second mother to Natsuki. I have to tell her, but I can’t just tell her blunty, I need to use tact because I know she’ll be devastated. But...
M: How can I do that when I’m in pain as well? How can I be strong for Natsuki when I’m… not... 
M: Think… think… 
M: I need to go to *that* place, I need to unlock the right words to say... 
M: For Natsuki. She deserves to know. 
SUMMER 2 GOOD END
MC: …
Natsuki: H-Hey, what’s wrong? Trying to keep all the curry to yourself? Heh...
M: That’s right... Natsuki is always good at communicating her feelings unfiltered. Maybe, this time I can do the same.
MC: ...Natsuki, I’m sorry.
Natsuki: H-Huh?
MC: I, uh… I don’t have the right words to say it, but… she passed on last Spring. That’s why I’m here actually… I’m sorry I didn’t tell you sooner. I just haven’t really come to terms with it myself yet, so… 
Natsuki: …so sh-she’s, gone…? 
M: My throat felt dry and my chest felt heavy. All I could give her was a simple nod.
Natsuki: I-I see…
MC: I’m sorry Natsuki, I really should have told you right away, I just--
Natsuki: I-Idiot! I’m… I’m not upset about that, I understand that part…but.. but!!
Natsuki: Keeping all that pain to yourself! Idiot, what are childhood friends for...
Natsuki: You can rely on me too, you know…
MC: Natsuki…
M: Her eyes were glossy, but I never saw a tear drop. I knew she was hurting, yet…
MC: …
MC: Is it really okay… to rely on you?
Natsuki: Of course, idiot… you shouldn’t have to ask...
M: Natsuki understands. She understands that I don’t have to be strong right now. That I can just… be me right now. Talking about it right now brings back a wave of memories, as if she just passed yesterday. It’s heavy. 
M: It hurts.
Natsuki: H-Hey… 
Natsuki: Would it be okay if… next time you pay respects to her… can I come to give her an offering to? I have a lot of things to thank her for... she put up with a lot of my outbursts, back in the day...
M: Pay respects… I haven’t done that since her funeral. I’ve been afraid to, because that would mean accepting everything, accepting that she’s… 
MC: …
M: But maybe, if I have someone go with me, it won’t be as hard. It might be nice to see Mom again.
M: And if I’m going to take anyone with me…
MC: Let’s go together next time, Natsuki.
SUMMER 2 BAD END
MC: …
M: I couldn’t think of the right words to say. I want to just say nothing at all, but that isn’t fair to Natsuki… 
MC: uh… she…
Natsuki: Hah? Speak up idiot, I can’t hear you over your city accent… 
MC: ...
MC: My family… er, my mom uh… 
MC: ...
Natsuki: Ehhh? I don’t understand what you’re say--
MC: She died, okay? I came back alone, there’s no one at my house to visit. I’m all alone.
M: Before I realized it, my words came spilling out. Once my self-awareness hit, I see a shocked Natsuki in front of me. 
M: Shit… my chest feels even heavier as feelings of regret begin to seep in.  
MC: Natsuki sorry I--
Natsuki: N-No, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have been impatient, I… I didn’t know that sh-she… 
Natsuki: I’m sorry, okay!? I messed up. I’m sorry… I have to go…
MC: Natsuki wait--
M: Before I could say anything, she was already gone. I should have been more upfront with my feelings, like Natsuki...
M: I should have just told her that I was struggling to say what I meant, instead of forcing words out like that. We’re childhood friends, she wouldn’t have judged me for being honest. She’s Natsuki. She treasures unfiltered feelings the most
M: and I should’ve known that.
MC: Natsuki… It wasn’t your fault...

SUMMER 3
M: Midterm season has passed, and finally I can enjoy summer vacation. Track practices have become more frequent, meaning I’m seeing a lot more of Natsuki. She drags me along and has me run errands for her team now.
M: I don’t particularly mind though. If I’m going to wait for her after school, I might as well be useful. Now that it’s summer vacation, I’m excited to spend time visiting old places with Natsuki, just like when we were kids.
Natsuki: Hey hey, what do I do for this one? I square it right? ‘Cause I’m getting 34 and the answer in the back is saying 3 squareroot of 5…
M: ...or so I thought. I let out an exasperated sigh.
MC: No, like I said, you’re forgetting to apply the formula in the third step Natsuki… 
Natsuki: Hehe oh yeah! Just like the last problem, ok I’ll try again.
M: Unfortunately, the only place new I’ve visited with Natsuki is her house. It is nice to come back after all these years, but I was hoping we could at least go to the beach or something fun. 
M: Instead, I’m keeping Natsuki company while she does her summer homework. Apparently she did really bad on her midterms, so her parents begged me to help her out. Not that I’m all that great with school either but... 
Natsuki: Aha! This one was easy, the answer was clearly-- w-wait that answer doesn’t look like mine at all… 
M: ...it could be worse.
MC: C’mon Natsuki, this should be review for you. The math teacher went over this part recently, too. Do you not take notes?
Natsuki: I know I know, jeez you sound like my parents. I take notes but, I don’t do any of the suggested problems… I haven’t really been doing the homework, either...
MC: Really? Natsuki! No wonder your midterms went poorly…
Natsuki: I get it I get it! It’s just track is getting really busy, y’know? I have to plan out the perfect workout routines for them and go to every practice. We’re preparing for the biggest meet of the year. We don’t have enough money for a proper coach, so…
Natsuki: Plus I really want to win! I made a bet with them if we lose, so I have to give it my all while they’re all pumped!
MC: A bet? 
Natsuki: Yeah yeah, every year for this big track meet, I let them choose some sort of punishment. Last year they made me wear a maid costume at the cultural festival, disgusting…
MC: O-Oh… 
Natsuki: Yeah. This year, they won’t even tell me what my punishment, hmph. They say it’s going to take the most courage out of all the punishments they’ve thought of. Not looking forward to that… 
Natsuki: But I won’t have to! ‘Cause we’re totally going to win this year, I know it! Hehe
MC: Some ruthless team. Why go as far to take a punishment though? If they’re your teammates, there’s no need to subject yourself to that.
Natsuki: No… need? Sh-shut up!! You vanilla ass normie! 
Natsuki: It gets them pumped up, mmkay? It’s tradition! Tradition!!! 
MC: Okay okay sorry, sorry. You know how to coach your team.
Natsuki: Hmmph. It gets them motivated and excited, and makes practices more fun. Brings up the mood, y’know? A small team like ours with no proper coach or schedule in place is usually the laughing stock at meets like that…
Natsuki: Our first year, our team was practically scoffed at just for signing up. So I came up with this idea to make it fun, whether we won or lost. It would unite us as a team, which is really important, too. 
MC: That’s… a good point, actually…
M: I’ve been in the city for so long, I forgot sports teams from the countryside stand little chance to other fancy schools. I know I wouldn’t be excited to get pummelled by schools that already look down on me.
MC: Good for you, Natsuki. Your team is lucky to have a captain like you.
Natsuki: E-Eh??
Natsuki: …
Natsuki: Wh-whatever. I put a lot of time into this team, might as well give it my all… 
Natsuki: I have a lot of good memories with my team, afterall
MC: Memories, huh? This town has a lot of those for me too. Even if I haven’t been here as long as you.
Natsuki: It really does! I don’t know why anyone would ever leave this place after spending their whole life here. So many happy times in this quiet place. Idiots say it’s boring, but I think it’s the opposite!
Natsuki: ‘Cause going to the store isn’t just going to the store. It’s going to the same market I went to with my parents when I was young, buying the same brand of fish. It’s meaningful! Even if the store sign looks a lil different now-a-days…
Natsuki: It’s a meaningful journey! 
MC: Buying fish is a meaningful journey…? You’re still a weirdo, Natsuki. But I see what you mean. Even if things look different, even walking to school brings me nostalgia…
Natsuki: Oh yeah! That one path, heh. We’d walk that way after playing in the park, tiring ourselves out. Your mom would always scold us for getting dirt in the house, fufu~
MC: …
Natsuki: Those were some fun times. Especially when she’d cook for us after, don’t you think?
MC: …
M: Nostalgia is an interesting feeling. It initially feels happy and warm, but as the feeling sets in, I start to feel strangely empty. Maybe that’s why I don’t enjoy this town in the same way Natsuki does.
Natsuki: Hey idiot… 
Natsuki: I know it’s hard, but it’s good to talk about her, you know. Memories are what keep people alive.
MC: Y-Yeah… I guess that’s true.
Natsuki: I understand it’s difficult at first, though. It’s not completely the same but, when you left, I avoided so many places, ‘cause all they brought were memories of y-you…
Natsuki: I thought it’d be easier to pretend you never existed. But that’s kinda hard to do in a little town, where every part of it had my favor-- I-I mean, some memories to them…
Natsuki: So eventually I came to accept that you were gone, but the memories weren’t. So a piece of you would still be here, in this town... It’s nice right? That even after people leave or kick the bucket or whatever… 
Natsuki: ...they still leave a part of them behind...
Natsuki: And soon enough, those places I used to avoid became places of comfort, because of those memories, so...
Natsuki: S-So what I mean! Is that unless you get bonked on the head or something, those memories with your mom are permanent.
M: Permanent… that’s interesting. I see what she means now, how they keep people alive.
MC: ...
M: Thank you, Natsuki.
MC: Heh. You’ve grown up a lot.
Natsuki: G-Grown up? Shut up loser we’re like the same age. I didn’t even say anything… I just like this town a lot…
MC: Whatever. And for the record, my mom would scold *you* for bringing dirt into the house. I was never as filthy as you, pig.
Natsuki: P-Pig!? I’m going to punch your little city boy mouth, ya hear???
M: Natsuki usually acts without tact, but... she says some very wise things at times. Things that… have helped me heal. She’s right, I shouldn’t be afraid to talk about my mother. After all, we had a lot of wonderful memories, especially in this town…
M: Maybe I’m starting to see the appeal of nostalgia. Just a bit.
MC: A-Anyways, go finish your math homework so we can do something fun. It’s bright out, I’m sick of being inside.
Natsuki: Hmph, don’t tell me what to do. I was just takin’ a little break.
M: Sigh, Natsuki. Some things will never change. I admire how much time she invests into her team, but now she’s in remedial classes because of it. I feel like I’m a bit of a distraction now, too.
M: She’s given me amazing advice and has been a source of familiarity and comfort while I was finding my way at this school. The least I can do is support her, but… she can’t afford to repeat her senior year of high school either. 
MC: Natsuki…
Natsuki: Hm? Didn’t you tell me to do my work!? Idiot…
MC: Oh, r-right…
MC: ...
M: I want to support her, but I don’t want to say the wrong thing and encourage her to fail her classes. I know how much her team means to her, but…
M: I know what I have to do. I need to go back to *that* place, and unlock the right words.
M: I want to support her.
SUMMER 3 GOOD END
M: After spending so much time watching her practice with her team, there’s no question that Natsuki’s heart is in the right place. Nagging her like a parent won’t do much for Natsuki.
MC: Natsuki... you know, I think you work really hard, in your own way. I’m sure it’s hard to balance your grades with that, but I hope you try to take it more seriously.
MC: Because I’m sure you want to graduate and set a good example for your teammates, right? And…
MC: We can’t graduate together if you have to repeat your senior year.
Natsuki: H-Huh? Where’d this come from, d-do you have a fever or something…
MC: No, I really do want to graduate together. We grew up together, what would be better than graduating in my hometown with my childhood friend? But, we can’t do that if you do poorly on your finals...
Natsuki: T-Together…? 
Natsuki: I-I mean, yeah of course idiot, I’m not going to fail or anything. I’m not THAT dumb… so…
Natsuki: D-Don’t worry… we’ll graduate together, ‘kay?
MC: Heh. Okay, I’ll trust that.
Natsuki: Whatever. Stupid.
Natsuki: …
Natsuki: Speaking of end of the year stuff, you’re coming to the meet I was talking about, right…?
MC: Of course. I come to all the practices, how can I not support you on the most important day?
Natsuki: Shut up, you’re disgusting me. But okay…
Natsuki: Cheer me on, ‘kay?
MC: If ‘cheer me on’ means have a pack of melon soda ready for you after, then yes, I will.
NatsukI: Hey! I mean it! Don’t try to fatten me up...
M: That day, I realized my favorite part of our past summer vacations wasn’t the trips to the beach, or the days spent eating home-cooked food together, or even the spontaneous adventures we got into…
M: Simply sitting inside, watching Natsuki do her math… gives me the same sense of joy that reminds me of childhood. The same happiness I’d get when we’d spend our days outside, getting into trouble as kids.
M: Perhaps, that’s what Natsuki meant earlier, about memories. About nostalgia. But… I don’t think it’s just the town that makes me feel so fondly about the past.
Natsuki: Aha! I got it, too easy~
MC: …
M: Yeah, it’s definitely not just the town that makes me feel this way.
SUMMER 3 BAD END
MC: Hey Natsuki...
M: I want to support her, but… I’m also afraid of her losing focus on what’s important. I’m afraid but, I couldn’t figure out why.
MC: I know the track meet is coming up and all, but… you should really focus on your grades. They can’t continue to slip like this, you know--
Natsuki: I get it, I get it. Sheesh, you sound like my parents… In fact, you sound like everyone else. You just don’t get it…
Natsuki: I put a lot of effort into that team, don’t you see it? I’m trying but, so many of my teammates are relying on me.
M: That’s right… Natsuki isn’t a lazy person. She has goals, and she’s responsible, too. I could see it every time I’d watch her team practice… maybe I still have the old Natsuki from ten years ago in my head.
M: That isn’t fair to her, though…
MC: I’m sorr--
Natsuki: Nah. It’s fine. You’re right, I can’t let them slip, I just thought I wouldn’t have to be nagged this time.
MC: ...
Natsuki: …I’m going to continue this section…
MC: Y-Yeah…
M: Shit… I hurt her feelings. I should’ve been more considerate in how I expressed my concerns…
M: Natsuki diligently works on her homework, staying unusually quiet. It’s rare to see her like this… unless she’s feeling hurt...
MC: Hey, Natsuki…
Natsuki: Yeah?
MC: Can I go to the track meet still? To… support you?
Natsuki: Duh, idiot. You come to all the practices anyways, go ahead.
MC: Alright…
M: I made her feel bad today, but... maybe I can make it up to her at the track meet.
MC: …
M: As Natsuki continues to work in silence, my mind wanders to our conversation earlier. About memories. We only talked about them in a positive sense, and how they linger, even after people do. But… what about negative memories? Do they linger too?
M: I want memories to last forever, especially ones I make with Natsuki, but maybe...
M: I’d prefer her to not remember today.
