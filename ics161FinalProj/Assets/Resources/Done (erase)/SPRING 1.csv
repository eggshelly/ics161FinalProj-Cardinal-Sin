MC,Ah… so tiring!,none,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
M,I let out a relieved sigh and stretch out in relief on my desk. I just completed my first day at my new high school.,default,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
M,Besides the fact it’s been almost a year since I’ve been through a proper school dayXYZ everyone was excited to see a new transfer studentXYZ especially a senior.,default,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
MC,I’ve spent so much time in the city that I forgot how easily things can become news in a small town.,none,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
MC,Where to now…,none,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
M,Even if I won’t be here longXYZ it won’t do me any good if I’m getting lost all semester.,default,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
M,I proceed to explore the schoolXYZ taking mental note of each turn…,default,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
M,…,default,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
M,…?,default,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
M,...erXYZ or so I thought. I forgot how many turns I made and now I don’t even know which way to start backtracking. Shoot...,default,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
MC,Why does every classroom look the same?? Am I even in the same building…,none,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
Haruka,AhXYZ sorry to botherXYZ but do you think you might be lost?,surprise2,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
M,I hear a small yet familiar sounding voice from behind me.,default,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
M,D-Did I just say what I said before out loud?? Oh crap...,default,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
MC,UhhhXYZ yesXYZ yes I am. I just transferred hereXYZ so...,none,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
M,SmallTalk.exe not found.,default,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
M,I turn around and see a small-framed girl with blush colored hair and bright green eyes. OhXYZ I thought she sounded familiar… it’s the cherry blossom girl I had a strange conversation with earlier.,default,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
Haruka,Oh!,surprise2_blush,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
M,Before I could confirm my assumptionsXYZ Haruka’s face beamed with the same sudden realization.,default,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
Haruka,I saw you while walking to schoolXYZ didn’t I? Sorry for not introducing myself earlier. My name is Haruka FurukawaXYZ you introduced yourself to my class today.,smile,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
MC,AhXYZ nice to properly meet you.,none,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
Haruka,You just moved hereXYZ right? This school can be pretty confusing. If I’m not paying attention I could easily walk pass our classroom tooXYZ hehe.,default2,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
M,Our classroom…? I look to my rightXYZ and sure enoughXYZ there’s a familiar sign clearly labelled with my classroom number.,default,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
M,Shit.,default,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
MC,O-Oh... I really was lost. Thank youXYZ I would’ve been in circles for hours.,none,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
M,I could feel my face glow with embarrassment.,default,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
Haruka,Hehe. You’re not wrong thoughXYZ this school is pretty modernXYZ so many of the hallways look similar.,default,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
MC,That’s for sure.,none,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
M,Hmm... I hate to ask a strangerXYZ but at this rateXYZ I’ll be walking in circles the rest of my high school life.,default,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
MC,HarukaXYZ I don’t really know anyone else at this schoolXYZ so… if you’re not busyXYZ do you think you could show me around?,none,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
Haruka,Hm?,surprise2,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
M,I felt a second wave of embarrassment take over. Our conversation earlier wasn’t the most… conventional. I’m not so sure someone like Haruka would want to show some gloomy guy around.,default,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
M,Before I could turn any redderXYZ Haruka smiles shyly.,default,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
Haruka,Sure! If you don’t mind me. I can show you around right nowXYZ if you’d like.,smile,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
MC,I would appreciate that. Thank you.,none,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
Haruka,Great! I’ll show you the library firstXYZ it’s my favorite place…,joy2,SPRING,BG hallway
,,,,
M,She shows me around the libraryXYZ fieldXYZ and other school facilities.,default,SPRING,BG lib1
,,,,
M,We naturally make small talk.,default,SPRING,BG lib1
,,,,
MC,If the library is your favorite placeXYZ I’m guessing you’re the studious typeXYZ then?,none,SPRING,BG lib1
,,,,
Haruka,Mmm I try! ButXYZ I’m still nowhere near as diligent as our class rep. I don’t usually go to the library to just studyXYZ though.,joy,SPRING,BG lib1
,,,,
MC,Hm? What else would you do there?,none,SPRING,BG lib1
,,,,
Haruka,Mm I dunnoXYZ sometimes readXYZ sometimes just have time to myself,default,SPRING,BG lib1
,,,,
MC,I see...,none,SPRING,BG lib1
,,,,
M,Time to herself? She definitely doesn’t seem like an introvert to me. Especially with her rather uh… interesting cherry blossom dialogue earlier…,default,SPRING,BG lib1
,,,,
Haruka,Mhm! But… that’s not as often. I usually go out with friends after school if I have the timeXYZ although it’s hard to find new things to do in such a small townXYZ hehe,default2,SPRING,BG lib1
,,,,
MC,Heh. Tell me about it. That’s one thing I’ll miss from the city.,none,SPRING,BG lib1
,,,,
M,Going out with friends after schoolXYZ idling time away in the library… she’s living the dream high school life. Plus she can easily make conversation with a stranger. With a personality like thatXYZ she probably gets along well with anyone.,default,SPRING,BG lib1
,,,,
M,I wish… that stuff came easily to meXYZ too.,default,SPRING,BG lib1
,,,,
M,We spend a while conversingXYZ Haruka kindly showing me all the important places.,default,SPRING,BG lib1
,,,,
Haruka,AaandXYZ were back to the classroom. I tried to cover all the important places…,default,SPRING,BG classroom
,,,,
MC,Already? Time flew... I really owe you one.,none,SPRING,BG classroom
,,,,
M,The copper sunset shines through the hall windows. A lot of time really had passed… It was going to get dark soon.,default,SPRING,BG classroom
,,,,
M,Haruka notices me staring out the windowXYZ and looks at the dim sky as well.,default,SPRING,BG classroom
,,,,
Haruka,Ah! It’s already getting darkXYZ I should get going…,neutral2_blush,SPRING,BG classroom
,,,,
M,Oh no… I kept her here this longXYZ I feel bad. Should I offer to walk her home? Maybe that’s too bold to ask right now… but…,default,SPRING,BG classroom
,,,,
M,The right thing to do is offer to walk her home. PlusXYZ maybe I’ll get to know her a bit better. It’s been a while since I’ve really… made friends...,default,SPRING,BG classroom
,,,,
MC,HarukaXYZ it’s my fault for keeping you out this late. Is it okay I walk you home?,none,SPRING,BG classroom
,,,,
Haruka,Oh! D-Don’t worry… you don’t have to…,surprise2_blush,SPRING,BG classroom
,,,,
MC,I knowXYZ but it’s the least I can do. Is it okayXYZ then?,none,SPRING,BG classroom
,,,,
Haruka,Ah sure… thank you...,neutral_blush,SPRING,BG classroom
,,,,
M,We grab our things and make our way out the school. That’s when my thoughts begin to wander.,default,SPRING,BG grass2
,,,,
M,We just met but… she seems awfully generous to show a stranger around. And then that conversation near the blossoms as well… it seems a bit odd…,default,SPRING,BG grass2
,,,,
M,Unlike beforeXYZ Haruka was strangely quiet.,default,SPRING,BG grass2
,,,,
M,And why didn’t she notice who I was earlier…? Is it really just a coincidence?,default,SPRING,BG grass2
,,,,
M,I think hard. I want to ask her straight outXYZ but I don’t want to come off accusatory. I need evidence. I don’t know how to approach thisXYZ I just met her after all…,default,SPRING,BG grass2
,,,,
M,Just think… what can I say to figure this out…?,default,SPRING,BG grass2
