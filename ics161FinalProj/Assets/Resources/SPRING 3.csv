M, Haruka’s tone dimsXYZ and the usual cheerful ring to her voice is gone. The last time I heard Haruka sound like this was when we first had lunch togetherXYZ and she told me about her father. I could tell something was wrong.,default,SPRING,default

Haruka, So I decided I’d get into a good college and make good money in an officeXYZ just like my Mom. So that she doesn’t have to work so hard all the time. I study and studyXYZ and my grades really have improved but…,default,SPRING,default
M, Haruka looks at her paper. I could see her eyes appear shinierXYZ as if she’s holding back tears.,default,SPRING,default
Haruka, With grades like theseXYZ I don’t know how I’ll be able to do any of that…,default,SPRING,default
