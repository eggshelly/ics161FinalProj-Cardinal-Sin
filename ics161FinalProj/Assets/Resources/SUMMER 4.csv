Natsuki,Whatever. This isn’t some cheerleading tournamentXYZ idiot. Hmph. Their smug little facesXYZ ugh!,surprise2,SUMMER relax,BG grass1
,,,,
M,Natsuki’s team overall came 2nd... to last. Natsuki and another senior placed in top three in their respective eventsXYZ but were completely outmatched in every other one.,default,SUMMER relax,BG grass1

,,,,
MC,...I understand. You seemed to enjoy yourselfXYZ didn’t you? Your team was definitely the rowdiest there. All the other teams looked too serious and bored.,none,SUMMER relax,BG grass2

Natsuki,Heh. I taught them well. Hopefully they’re just as obnoxiously loud next yearXYZ and carry on my legacy.,smile2,SUMMER relax,BG grass2
,,,,
Natsuki,...,sad_surprise,SUMMER relax,BG grass2
,,,,
MC,I don’t even think they’re capable of being anything but loud. But… I can understand your feelings about it ending. It’s exciting we’re going to graduateXYZ but it’s hard knowing what we’re leaving behind. And with your attachment to this town...,none,SUMMER relax,BG grass2

,,,,
Natsuki,Heh. Thought you’d recognize it. It’s one of the few places in town that’s remained untouched.,neutral_blush,SUMMER relax,BG grass2

,,,,
Natsuki,Hehe~ I wanted to take you hereXYZ but there wasn’t much time over summer break. It’s our ‘secret baseXYZ’ remember?,neutral2,SUMMER relax,BG grass2
,,,,
M,I give Natsuki a silent nod. Natsuki and I played here a lot after schoolXYZ and even more frequently over summer vacation. Some timesXYZ Natsuki would even call a ‘secret meeting’ and throw a paper airplane into my roomXYZ telling me to come here.,default,SUMMER relax,BG grass2
,,,,
MC,Good times...,none,SUMMER relax,BG grass2
,,,,
M,Natsuki sat down on a swingXYZ swaying back and forthXYZ looking at the setting sun. It felt nice to come back here with herXYZ after all these years.,default,SUMMER relax,BG grass2

MC,YeahXYZ it has. I didn’t realize it until we talked butXYZ I really missed this town. Lots of… happy memories…It was good my family told me to come here. It was helpful to be supported by a familiar faceXYZ too.,none,SUMMER relax,BG grass2

MC,...of the bet?,none,SUMMER relax,BG grass2
,,,,
Natsuki,O-Oh. Just that. Whew...,surprise2,SUMMER relax,BG grass2
,,,,
Natsuki,Nah. I’m off the hook for thatXYZ kinda. They said since I placed the highest they’d give me a ‘break’. But... those little demons! They’re still pushing me to do the worst part of the bet. They’re bulliesXYZ I tell you!,smile,SUMMER relax,BG grass2
,,,,
MC,What? Weren’t you the one yelling at me saying it was ‘tradition’ ? But hmm… only part of the bet? What was this bet that you were so afraid ofXYZ anyways?,none,SUMMER relax,BG grass2

,,,,
Natsuki,P-Public confession. In front of everyone. UghXYZ that would’ve been terrible...,tsundere_blush,SUMMER relax,BG grass2
,,,,
MC,Public confession? Ha! That would be… quite an interesting sight. The spunky track captainXYZ confessing her love in such a romantic way.,none,SUMMER relax,BG grass2
,,,,
MC,That’s not such a bad betXYZ though. You could’ve just let someone know beforehand it’s a joke. AlthoughXYZ you’d have to deal with some interesting rumorsXYZ that kind of stuff spreads fast in our town.,none,SUMMER relax,BG grass2
,,,,
Natsuki,S-Someone? You’re not just supposed to confess to ‘someoneXYZ’ idiot. It’s a terrible betXYZ hmph.,surprise2_blush,SUMMER relax,BG grass2

MC,WaitXYZ don’t tell me you actually have someone you’d confess to…?,none,SUMMER relax,BG grass2
,,,,
Natsuki,Wh-Who says I don’tXYZ idiot? I’m a girl tooXYZ you know…,tsundere_blush,SUMMER relax,BG grass2
,,,,
M,I’ve been friends with Natsuki for so longXYZ yet I’ve never really heard her talk about boys like that. I honestly can’t even imagine her doing such a romantic gesture.,default,SUMMER relax,BG grass2
,,,,
M,…or maybeXYZ I don’t want to.,default,SUMMER relax,BG grass2
,,,,
M,But… since I’ve come backXYZ we’ve spent so much time together. She would’ve told me if she liked someoneXYZ right…? Or maybe she doesn’t trust me? It’s not really like her to hide that from meXYZ though...,default,SUMMER relax,BG grass2
,,,,
M,Something doesn’t add up…,default,SUMMER relax,BG grass2
,,,,
M,A familiar feeling arises. I’m going to *that* placeXYZ againXYZ I feel it. Natsuki looks off into the distanceXYZ seemingly lost in her thoughts.,default,SUMMER relax,BG grass2
,,,,
M,I want to… unlock the right thing to say. Because even if I leave this town againXYZ even if I leave Natsuki once more,default,SUMMER relax,BG grass2
,,,,
M,I don’t want the distance to grow between my childhood friend and I. Not again.,default,SUMMER relax,BG grass2
,,,,
M,And this might be my last chance to prevent that.,default,SUMMER relax,BG grass2
