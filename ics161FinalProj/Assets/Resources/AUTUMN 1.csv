SPEAKER,CONVO,SPRITE
M, Today was rather cold. Seems like the perfect day to grab some hot coffee.,default
M, So convenient there’s one close to the school…,default
Akiko, Welcome!! Have a seat right over here please~,default
M, The tall waitress cheerfully beckons me overXYZ with a welcoming smile. Her warm colored hair and smile made me feel somehow at home.,default
M, A feeling I’ve been longing for with all of these changes.,default
MC, MmXYZ thank you…,default
Akiko, My name is AkikoXYZ if you need anything at all please let me know~,default
M, Her voice was soft and warmXYZ yet had a sense of maturity to it.,default
MC, HmmmXYZ I’ll have a vanilla latteXYZ with almond milk please.,default
Akiko, Alright! One vanilla latte with almond milk coming up~,default
M, Akiko swiftly spins on her heal and leavesXYZ her long russet strands of hair sweeping behind her like autumn leaves in the wind.,default
M, As I waitXYZ I sit and bask in the cafe’s peaceful ambiance.,default
M, The cozy aura mingled with the scent of coffee grounds felt like heaven compared to the stark breeze outside. I sniffle a few times just at the thought of the cold weather.,default
M, Her name was Akiko… right?,default
M, I turn to see the busy waitress hopping from table to tableXYZ yet always maintaining her warm demeanor. Must be hard to memorize all those orders by herself…,default
M, I realized too late that I was staring at her too longXYZ and Akiko meets my gaze with a friendly grin. She begins making her way to my table again.,default
Akiko, Sorry about the wait. Here is your latte~,default
M, She sets the cup downXYZ and a packet of tissues.,default
MC, Oh I didn’t--,default
Akiko, So sorryXYZ I’ll be right back!,default
M, Before I could comment on the tissues she misplacedXYZ she’s running off to greet more customers at the door.,default
M, I wonder why she left these here…,default
M, There’s no way she saw me sniffling before and left these for me? No… that’d be silly to think she’d notice that…,default
M, Before I could make a reasonable conclusionXYZ I see Akiko rushing back to my table.,default
Akiko, Sorry about thatXYZ I had to clock out so my coworker could take my place. Phew!,default
Akiko, I wanted to talk to you though.,default
MC, M-me?,default
Akiko, Ehh? Aww don’t tell me you don’t remember your own class rep…,default
M, !!!,default
M, Now that I think about itXYZ she did seem familiar. And she’s wearing our class uniform.,default
M, Akiko seemed to catch onto my realization. She giggles.,default
Akiko, HeheheXYZ no need to worryXYZ I’m just kidding~,default
Akiko, My name is Akiko Shimizu. You’re our new transferXYZ hmm?,default
MC, Y-Yeah. SorryXYZ I remember you now.,default
Akiko, HeheXYZ no worries at all. Are you here to study for your college entrance exams?,default
MC, ActuallyXYZ noXYZ I just wanted to explore the town a bit.,default
M, AlthoughXYZ with all this “new season new me” stuff… I sort of forgot about those.,default
Akiko, Ehhh? They’re really importantXYZ you know. You only get one shot!,default
Akiko, HoweverXYZ rest is important too. If you ever fall too behind thoughXYZ this cafe is a pleasant place to study. At leastXYZ I think so.,default
M, Her words sounded concernedXYZ yet her tone remained warm and friendly. She really is a class rep.,default
M, I sniffle a few more timesXYZ and Akiko looks at me with a concerned look on her face.,default
Akiko, AhhXYZ coffee isn’t good for colds you know. Let me grab you some tea.,default
MC, Ah waitXYZ it’s oka--,default
M, Before I could even get the rest of my sentence outXYZ she’s already up and gone.,default
MC, *Sigh* What a quick girl.,default
M, I sniffle a few more times. I could really use a tissue right now...,default
M, My eyes veer towards the tissuesXYZ still next to my untouched latte.,default
M, If she accidently left them hereXYZ that’d be pretty rude if I just took one… but…,default
M, my nose…,default
M, She seems nice enough but… agh…,default
M, A familiar sense of indecisiveness fills my chest as my nose starts to burn more and more.,default
MC, *sniffle*,default
