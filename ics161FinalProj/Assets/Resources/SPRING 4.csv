Teacher, ...these youthful years will be coming to an end soon.,default,SPRING,default
Teacher, But before thenXYZ don’t slack off!! Exams are almost upon us! Don’t forget to turn in assignments 3.2-3.4 by the end of this week too!,default,SPRING,default
M, Almost a whole term has passed by since I’ve moved back to my childhood town. I’ve changed so much and experienced so much in this short time that I almost forgot that... eventually it would come to an end.,default,SPRING,default
M, The seed of worry was planted the first time college exams were mentioned. And since thenXYZ slowly I’ve spent more and more time realizing I won’t be here forever.,default,SPRING,default
M, I tried to tuck those thoughts away and spend time doing other thingsXYZ like learning pianoXYZ visiting cafesXYZ meeting new people,default,SPRING,default
M, And of courseXYZ spending time with Haruka. Since midtermsXYZ Haruka has been keen on having me try her food oftenXYZ so we usually spend lunch together.,default,SPRING,default
M, We always have so much to talk about that we end up finishing our conversations after class so... I usually just walk her home now.,default,SPRING,default
M, It’s a routine I’ve grown accustomed to.,default,SPRING,default
M, But...,default,SPRING,default
M, Even these happy moments can’t stop time.,default,SPRING,default
M, SoonXYZ my high school years will be over.,default,SPRING,default
M, And soonXYZ we will go our separate ways. These happy timesXYZ in this townXYZ at this schoolXYZ will never happen again.,default,SPRING,default
M, I tell myselfXYZ that’s just something I have to accept. Time is fleeting. Just like Haruka said about the cherry blossoms last SpringXYZ I should appreciate the temporary things even more…,default,SPRING,default
MC, Before they go...,none,SPRING,default
MC, But I don’t want them to go…,none,SPRING,default
M, Appreciation only goes so far... I can deal with admiring cherry blossoms from afarXYZ until they dwindle away and the season is over. But Haruka--,default,SPRING,default
Haruka, Hey!,default,SPRING,default
MC, H-Huh?,none,SPRING,default
M, Haruka giggles in front of me.,default,SPRING,default
Haruka, You’re completely out of itXYZ hehe. I asked if we’re still walking home today?,default,SPRING,default
MC, …,none,SPRING,default
M, These are the moments I don’t want to lose. No matter how mundaneXYZ I don’t want these simple things to be... temporary…,default,SPRING,default
MC, Yeah... sorry. I was just thinking…,none,SPRING,default
MC, Do you think we could make a detour on the way home?,none,SPRING,default
Haruka, Hm? SureXYZ sounds fun! Where did you want to go?,default,SPRING,default
MC, ...secret.,none,SPRING,default
M, Without saying muchXYZ we grabbed our bags and headed out. I led the way to somewhere I haven’t been in a while.,default,SPRING,default
Haruka, Hmm? You’re really set on keeping it a secretXYZ huh?,default,SPRING,default
MC, Ha... sorry. We’re almost there.,none,SPRING,default
M, We make our way to a paved pathXYZ not too far from the school. A path that isn’t so popular around this time of the year.,default,SPRING,default
M, But thereXYZ to meXYZ it will always be Spring. There doesn’t need to be cherry blossoms in full bloom for me to come here. Because... of the memories attached to this place.,default,SPRING,default
M, The people attached to this place.,default,SPRING,default
Haruka, Oh!,default,SPRING,default
M, The bare trees come into view. We stop and look at the treesXYZ dull and colorless.,default,SPRING,default
Haruka, HeheXYZ I see. This is where we first metXYZ isn’t it?,default,SPRING,default
MC, Mhm…,none,SPRING,default
M, Haruka looks at the trees as if they were dotted with blossoms still.,default,SPRING,default
Haruka, It’s almost the end of the school term...,default,SPRING,default
MC, Yeah… it isXYZ isn’t it…,none,SPRING,default
MC, Haruka…,none,SPRING,default
Haruka, Hm?,default,SPRING,default
MC, ...I wanted to take you here to say…,none,SPRING,default
MC, Thank you.,none,SPRING,default
Haruka, Thank you?,default,SPRING,default
MC, For that one day... the first time we metXYZ here. I’ve thought about that conversation a lotXYZ you know… do you remember?,none,SPRING,default
Haruka, Hehe. Of course I do! We talked about the blossomsXYZ and how they don’t last.,default,SPRING,default
MC, Yes. You talked about their temporariness in such a positive way.,none,SPRING,default
MC, Before thenXYZ I resented timeXYZ including the moving seasonsXYZ and anything that wasn’t permanent... but,none,SPRING,default
MC, You helped me see the good in those things. And how to turn it into appreciation. In the way that you do.,none,SPRING,default
Haruka, O-Oh! I’m happy my words... had that effect…,default,SPRING,default
M, Haruka gets flustered. She’s not really good with compliments. You’ve had a lot of impact on meXYZ Haruka.,default,SPRING,default
MC, Moving time is the only thing guaranteed in life. But I was afraid of the only thing that wasn’t temporary. The only thing that... could take things away...,none,SPRING,default
MC, But... you also knew that pain. Yet were somehow so cheerful all the timeXYZ and helpful... it made me really wonderXYZ how? How are you okay with time passing byXYZ when everything you know might disappear tomorrow,none,SPRING,default
Haruka, Ah...,default,SPRING,default
MC, ButXYZ by spending all this time with youXYZ I think... I see how. I couldn’t see it then butXYZ I’ve changed. I’ve...  been healing... Because time passed by...,none,SPRING,default
M, Because time passed by with you…,default,SPRING,default
Haruka, Hehe. You really haveXYZ changed,default,SPRING,default
Haruka, I think time passing truly is a scary thing. But you’re rightXYZ it’s the only thing we’re guaranteed in this life. But it’s a good thingXYZ I think,default,SPRING,default
Haruka, Because time passing means we have time to healXYZ and time to find happier things.,default,SPRING,default
M, But...,default,SPRING,default
Haruka, Like you! If time just stoppedXYZ I would have never met you.,default,SPRING,default
M, But!,default,SPRING,default
Haruka, So I’m grateful for time. Even if it has taken away things precious to me. I am still grateful.,default,SPRING,default
M, But!!!,default,SPRING,default
M, But it takes away so much tooXYZ Haruka!,default,SPRING,default
M, My fists clench. This momentXYZ right nowXYZ I am so terribly happy. But that happiness is what makes me so terribly afraid.,default,SPRING,default
M, I’m afraid. But... I don’t want to ruin this... moment with her.,default,SPRING,default
M, I have to go to *that* place again. I have to know the right thing to say. So I can treasure this moment properly.,default,SPRING,default
M, PleaseXYZ guide me again.,default,SPRING,default
