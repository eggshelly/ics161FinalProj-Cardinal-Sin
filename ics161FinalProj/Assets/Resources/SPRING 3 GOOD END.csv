MC, Haruka… you’re too hard on yourself.,none,SPRING,default
Haruka, Eh?,default,SPRING,default
M, The words came out even before Haruka could fizzle back into my vision. Once againXYZ that *place* has guided me.,default,SPRING,default
MC, You think of everyone else’s happiness all the timeXYZ and don’t give yourself enough credit. You said you struggled beforeXYZ right? So… since you’ve made progress…,none,SPRING,default
MC, You should be proud.,none,SPRING,default
Haruka, …,default,SPRING,default
Haruka, You’re so kindXYZ you know…,default,SPRING,default
Haruka, I’m still pretty sad right nowXYZ so I probably can’t feel it yet but…,default,SPRING,default
Haruka, Thank you… you’re right… I should be proud.,default,SPRING,default
Haruka, To be honestXYZ I… I can’t really imagine myself cooped up in a corporate building. My mom complains about work meetings and conflict all the timeXYZ yet she’s able to lead all those people…,default,SPRING,default
Haruka, I just can’t really see myself doing that. My mom always said I took after my father in that way… he was a freelance creative writer. A ‘free birdXYZ’ she’d call it,default,SPRING,default
Haruka, I always thought I’d be like that tooXYZ but with art. But…,default,SPRING,default
M, Haruka shifts around uncomfortablyXYZ looking down at the ground.,default,SPRING,default
Haruka, But… I can’t support my family doing that.,default,SPRING,default
MC, But your dad…? Didn’t he support you guys when he was a writer?,none,SPRING,default
Haruka, MhmXYZ yeah… but that was because he worked freelance for yearsXYZ so he was able to build a loyal clientele. I don’t want to make my mom wait for that…,default,SPRING,default
Haruka, SoXYZ I decided I’d throw that dream awayXYZ for the sake of my mom… and my brother tooXYZ of course. I want him to be able to chase his dreamsXYZ and be happy.,default,SPRING,default
MC, But…,none,SPRING,default
MC, What about your happiness?,none,SPRING,default
Haruka, Hm?,default,SPRING,default
MC, Your momXYZ doesn’t she work hard for you? I’m sure of it… the fact she taught you all her recipes and works long hours... she wants you to be happy. I don’t know her but,none,SPRING,default
MC, I have a feeling she wouldn’t want to hear her daughter say that she’s throwing away her dreams for the sake of her mother.,none,SPRING,default
MC, There’s something that I really admire about your altruismXYZ Haruka. ButXYZ I think you should remember that,none,SPRING,default
MC, It’s okay to live for yourselfXYZ too.,none,SPRING,default
Haruka, Ah…,default,SPRING,default
M, I made sure my words were said with certaintyXYZ out of hope she would believe them too. I may have just met Haruka this year but… she has already shown me so much kindness.,default,SPRING,default
M, Despite going through similar tragic eventsXYZ she still thinks of others. While I… just let time pass by. In my own world.,default,SPRING,default
M, So this timeXYZ I want to make something out of my hurt. I want to be like HarukaXYZ and use it to help others. Especially her.,default,SPRING,default
Haruka, … I was wrong about you…,default,SPRING,default
MC, H-Huh?,none,SPRING,default
Haruka, At the road with the cherry blossoms… I called you darkXYZ remember?,default,SPRING,default
M, I do. She giggles. Typical Haruka... even when she’s sad.,default,SPRING,default
Haruka, Now you’re the one being optimisticXYZ and I’m gloomy.,default,SPRING,default
Haruka, But… you’re right. You’ve never met my mom butXYZ she’d totally scold the crap out of me for talking like that!!,default,SPRING,default
M, I can’t help but smile.,default,SPRING,default
MC, I told you so. C’monXYZ I’m sure she’d be proud of your score. And wherever you end up going to college.,none,SPRING,default
M, I’m also sure she’ll just be proud of raising someone so hardworking and kindXYZ Haruka.,default,SPRING,default
Haruka, Hehe…,default,SPRING,default
M, Haruka lets out a relieved sigh.,default,SPRING,default
Haruka, AaahXYZ I do like the library butXYZ it’s so stuffy! Want to celebrate the end of midterms with me? I’m feeling ice cream…,default,SPRING,default
MC, HahaXYZ of course. Except there’s not much to celebrate for meXYZ I barely passed…,none,SPRING,default
Haruka, Ehhhh? O-Oh no!! I’m sorry!! Here I was complaining….,default,SPRING,default
MC, Don’t worry about it Haruka. Let’s go out and celebrate like you said. Oh and maybe before we goXYZ tell your friends you’re okay? They seemed pretty worried.,none,SPRING,default
Haruka, Th-they were? I feel bad… but I’ll tell them. AlrightXYZ let’s head out!,default,SPRING,default
M, We grab our things and leave the library.,default,SPRING,default
M, Today I learned a lot about Haruka. During my short time hereXYZ I was able to learn a lot about herXYZ and learned so much from her. She’s helped me view so many things differently.,default,SPRING,default
M, And today… I was able to return the favor.,default,SPRING,default
M, I think… I would like to continue returning the favorXYZ for a very long time.,default,SPRING,default
