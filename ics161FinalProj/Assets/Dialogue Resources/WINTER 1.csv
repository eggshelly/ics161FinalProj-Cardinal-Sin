SPEAKER,CONVO,SPRITE
MC, Maybe I’ll check out the music rooms and see if there are any clubs to join.,default
MC, Clubs will be a good way to meet new peopleXYZ right?,default
M, I walk towards the music rooms,default
M, ...only to find them mostly empty and unused.,default
MC, SheeshXYZ well this is disappointing. Where is everyone?,default
M, Before I could let out a sigh of disappointmentXYZ I notice the gentle sound of a piano coming from a room at the end of the hall.,default
M, It’s so faintXYZ I could barely notice itXYZ but…,default
M, It’s played in such a beautiful wayXYZ as if it’s drawing me closer.,default
M, Before I realize itXYZ I’m a few steps away from the room the music is coming from.,default
MC, Clair de lune…,default
M, It’s one of my favorites. I stand thereXYZ dazedXYZ letting the music fill my ears… the air… the hall…,default
M, I stand thereXYZ like a zombieXYZ letting my body hang there like jelly. With all the new changesXYZ it’s been a while since I’ve been able to feel so…,default
MC, ...so at peace,default
M, As soon as those words leave my mouthXYZ a little louder than intendedXYZ an abrupt silence cuts off the sound. Louder than the song played before,default
M, The beautiful arrangement was replaced by a staccato of footstepsXYZ slowly heading towards the door.,default
M, Shoot… Shoot… they heard me…,default
M, I panic as the steps grow nearer.,default
M, The door opens… and a the mysterious pianist emerges from the other side. She stares at me with a blank lookXYZ her cold eyes staring sharply through me like icicles.,default
MC, Uhhhh….,default
M, MomentarilyXYZ I was stunned.,default
Touka, …,default
M, Oh god… I look like a creep now…,default
Touka, ...I’m done with the music room. My apologies if I took long. Feel free to use it...,default
MC, O-OhXYZ no no please feel free to keep playing. I didn’t mean to interruptXYZ I just really liked your playing…,default
M, The mystery player’s eyes widened slightly.,default
Touka, Mm. Is that so.,default
Touka, … Thank you.,default
M, She is sure hard to read… but looks like I didn’t scare her off.,default
MC, Yeah… I just transferred and was hoping to find a music club to join… but looks like there isn’t anyone hereXYZ ahaha…,default
Touka, Mm…,default
Touka, Music clubs don’t usually practice on these days…,default
Touka, So I am sure if you come another dayXYZ you could join.,default
M, She doesn’t say muchXYZ and comes off a little cold but… she’s quite kind of her to a stranger who interrupted her piano sesh.,default
M, Somehow her demeanor calmed my racing nerves from before. It is often comforting to be able to share silence with another person.,default
Touka, ... Debussy.,default
MC, H-Hm?,default
Touka, You said you liked my playing. It’s a classic by Debussy…,default
Touka, Have you heard… before…?,default
M, Agh yes! I love Clair de Lune. I’ve listened to it since I was a child. I want to talk to her about the piece she was playingXYZ it was so beautifulXYZ but…,default
M, ...if I start talking about itXYZ she may think I was spying her the whole time…,default
M, Do I really want to risk it…?,default
M, All of a suddenXYZ my mind becomes softXYZ like melted snow,default
M, My mind begins to succumb to the weight of pros and cons for each choiceXYZ becoming heavier each second I have nothing to say.,default
M, I’m frozen.,default
