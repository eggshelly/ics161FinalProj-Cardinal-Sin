SPEAKER,CONVO,SPRITE
MC, Today seems like a nice day to walk around the school.,default
MC, Even if I won’t be here longXYZ it won’t do me any good if I’m getting lost all semester.,default
M, I proceed to explore the schoolXYZ taking mental note of each turn…,default
M, erXYZ or so I thought. I forgot how many turns I made and now,default
M, I don’t even know which way to start backtracking. Shoot!,default
MC, Why does every classroom look the same?? Am I even in the same building…,default
Haruka, AhXYZ sorry to botherXYZ but do you think you might be lost?,default
M, I hear a small but friendly sounding voice from behind me.,default
M, D-Did I just say what I said before out loud?? Oh crap. Wasn’t that a girl’s voice too?,default
M, I get the urge to just pretend like I know where I’m goingXYZ but…,default
M, I remembered the promise I made to myself earlier this year. To be different.,default
M, I clear my throat and let whatever comes to my mind first become words.,default
MC, UhhhXYZ yesXYZ yes I am. I just transferred hereXYZ so...,default
M, SmallTalk.exe not found.,default
Haruka, Oh! I thought you looked familiar. You introduced yourself earlier in class. Mm… nice to meet youXYZ I’m Haruka Yamauchi.,default
M, I turn around and see a small-framed girl with blush colored hair and bright green eyes.,default
Haruka, This school can be pretty confusingXYZ if I’m not paying attention I could easily walk pass our classroom too.,default
M, Our classroom…? I look to my rightXYZ and sure enoughXYZ there’s a familiar sign clearly labelled with my classroom number.,default
MC, !!! Oh gosh... I really was lost. Thank youXYZ I would’ve been in circles for hours.,default
M, I could feel my face turn redXYZ and Haruka starts to giggleXYZ slightly.,default
Haruka, Hehe. You’re not wrong thoughXYZ this school is pretty modernXYZ so many of the hallways do look the same.,default
M, That’s for sure.,default
M, HmmXYZ Haruka looks like a responsible girl. I hate to ask a strangerXYZ but at this rateXYZ I’ll be walking in circles the whole semester.,default
MC, Haruka… if you’re not busyXYZ do you think you could show me around?,default
Haruka, Hm?,default
M, I felt a second wave of embarrassment take over. She probably has better things to do than show a transfer student around.,default
M, Before I could turn any redderXYZ Haruka smiles shyly.,default
Haruka, Sure! If you don’t mind me. I can show you around right nowXYZ if you’d like.,default
MC, I would appreciate that. Thank you,default
Haruka, Great! I’ll show you the library firstXYZ its my favorite place…,default
M, She shows me around for a few hoursXYZ and we make small talk.,default
M, I learn she’s pretty studiousXYZ but enjoys going out with friends often. She likes to have her quiet time in the library and read when she feels like being alone.,default
M, She has a cheerful and bright aura…,default
M, but I could tell she was naturally a bit reservedXYZ like me. I think we get along well.,default
Haruka, AaandXYZ were back to the classroom. I tried to cover all the important places…,default
MC, Already? WowXYZ time flew... I really owe you one.,default
M, The coppery sunset bled through the window. A lot of time really had passed…,default
M, It was going to get dark soon.,default
M, Haruka notices me staring out the windowXYZ and looks at the dim sky as well.,default
Haruka, Ah! It’s already getting darkXYZ I should get going…,default
M, Oh no… I kept her here this longXYZ I feel bad. Should I offer to walk her home?,default
M, Maybe that’s too bold to ask right now… but…,default
M, I turn to look at HarukaXYZ who’s still facing the russet colored window.,default
M, I really want to ask…,default
M, Out of nowhereXYZ my growing feelings of indecisiveness and insecurity are cut by a wave of dizziness... so strong it numbs my thoughts.,default
M, My consciousness goes blankXYZ and the saturated colors of the hallway slowly fades away with it…,default
