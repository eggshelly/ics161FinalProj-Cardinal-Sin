SPEAKER,CONVO,SPRITE
MC, Today seems like a nice day to walk around the school.,default
MC, Even if I won’t be here longXYZ it won’t do me any good if I’m getting lost all semester.,default
M, I proceed to explore the schoolXYZ taking mental note of each turn…,default
M, erXYZ or so I thought. I forgot how many turns I made and now,default
M, I don’t even know which way to start backtracking. Shoot!,default
MC, Why does every classroom look the same?? Am I even in the same building…,default
Haruka, AhXYZ sorry to botherXYZ but do you think you might be lost?,default
M, I hear a small but friendly sounding voice from behind me.,default
M, D-Did I just say what I said before out loud?? Oh crap. Wasn’t that a girl’s voice too? Just my luckXYZ I act like a fool in front of the first person I meet…,default
M, I get the urge to run awayXYZ or brush her off.,default
M, But then I realizeXYZ the promise I made to myself earlier this year. To be different.,default
M, I clear my throat and let whatever comes to my mind first become words.,default
MC, UhhhXYZ yesXYZ yes I am. I just transferred hereXYZ so...,default
M, SmallTalk.exe not found.,default
Haruka, Oh! I thought you looked familiar. You introduced yourself earlier. Ah… nice to meet youXYZ I’m Haruka Yamauchi.,default
M, I turn around and see a <DESCRIBE HER>,default
Haruka, This school can be pretty confusingXYZ if I’m not paying attention I could easily walk pass our classroom too.,default
M, too…? I look to my rightXYZ and sure enoughXYZ there’s a sign clearly labelled with my classroom number.,default
MC, !!! Oh gosh! I really was lost. Thank-youXYZ I would’ve been in circles for hours.,default
M, I start to turn redXYZ and Haruka starts to giggleXYZ slightly.,default
Haruka, Hehe. You’re not wrong thoughXYZ this school is pretty modernXYZ so many of the hallways do look the same.,default
M, That’s for sure…,default
M, Haruka looks like a responsible girl. I hate to ask people for thingsXYZ but at this rateXYZ I’ll be walking in circles the whole semester.,default
MC, AhXYZ I don’t want to trouble youXYZ but... do you think you could show me around? When you’re not busyXYZ of course…,default
Haruka, Hm?,default
M, I felt a second wave of embarrassment take over. I’m not used to doing things so boldXYZ but… I have to start somewhere.,default
M, Before I could turn any redderXYZ Haruka smiles shyly.,default
Haruka, Sure! If you don’t mind me. I can show you around right nowXYZ if you’d like.,default
M, I give her a smile backXYZ and a happy nod.,default
Haruka, Great! I’ll show you the library firstXYZ its my favorite place…,default
M, She shows me around for a few hoursXYZ and we make small talk.,default
M, She seems friendlyXYZ yet also reserved like me. I think we can get along well.,default
Haruka, AndXYZ were back to the classroom. I tried to cover all the important places…,default
MC, MmXYZ thank-you so much. I really owe you one. I don’t want to keep you any longerXYZ and it's getting pretty late so I’ll head off now…,default
M, In a cheery moodXYZ we say our goodbyes and I begin to turn to leave…,default
M, ...but I don’t get very far before I hear her voice call out to me again.,default
Haruka, Umm….,default
M, Haruka looks down at her feetXYZ fiddling with her fingers. As if she wants to say something.,default
M, If I leave now… she probably won’t get to say anything…,default
M, But if I make the mistake of assuming she has more to say… that’ll be awkward…,default
M, What do I do…?,default
M, Out of nowhereXYZ my growing feelings of indecisiveness and insecurity are cut by a wave of dizziness... so strong it numbs my thoughts.,default
M, My consciousness goes blankXYZ and the saturated colors of the hallway slowly fades away with it…,default
